------


 **Requirements:** 

·    Final Module

**Synopsis**: The Ritual of Fire is a Bloody Fist ritual to rip open the Fire plane. They have used this in the past to great effect. The Flame Drake elementals are very destructive and serve the purpose of the Bloody Fist. But during the ritual, the forces of Darkness has corrupted the ritual and used it as a gateway to attack! When they rift into existence, the Hoylean energy from the Chosen Ones module attracted their mortal enemies, the Murumbrians have arrived, and they seek the “chosen one” to take back to their time.

**Outcomes**:

(1) the players survive the onslaught, and the 1 Hour timer expires, the elementals are forcibly rifted back to their realm. There are many ways to “defeat” this module, but they cannot just simply escape the timer of it.

(2) The Murumbrians capture the “Chosen One” or the chosen one comes willingly with them. The assault will stop. The chosen one is then and take them back to their time to make an offer to since he was chosen. Run the module A conversation in Darkness. 

**Rumors:** “The Ley Lines of Stonewood have shifted dramatically as of recent. This, in my experience is the sign before a great ritual. To say what is to come is unknown. But the feeling on the wind is nothing but Sulfur and Pain. Sta Vigilant ance guard your components well”

**Running Notes**: The Ritual of Fire being corrupted was NOT something the Bloody Fist expected. The Bloody Fist intended to run when the Flame Drake Elementals were summoned but the nature of the Murumbrians tainted the ritual. This forced obedience upon the Bloody Fist. 

When the Murumbrians enter the field, the “Chosen One” will already have their Glowing Morumbrain Eyes active so the Murumbrians know who they are; and will hunt them for 1 hour. The entire site is active for play during this module. It is completely valid to hide and not fight them, but like a horror movie they will keep coming regardless.
