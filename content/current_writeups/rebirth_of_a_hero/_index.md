  Rumor Circulating the Town

  “A Dwarf with the likeness of one of Stonewoods original heroes has been seen around town. Though his clothing and weapons may have changed, there is no mistaking his Red beard and his helmet. His voice inspires courage and confidence in those around him. Though he was thought to be long dead or moved onto Golden Halls, Loken Oakrider was his name. If this really is Loken, then the Bloody Fist are in for a world of pain!”
