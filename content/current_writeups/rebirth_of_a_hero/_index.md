Layout: module
description: Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider, a hero of the Underdark War and of old Stonewood has been sighted around town lately. People thought he had been long dead or moved onto Golden Halls. With the Rebirth of the Bloody Fist, this living legend has re-emerged into Stonewood but something is different this time…
requirements: Know Your Enemy and Ripped Apart have both been ran.
Synopsis:  Loken Oakrider was a renowned hero in Old Stonewood before it was properly settled into the Barony of Woodhaven under the Duchy of Elysia. There was a great and terrible war with the Underdark and Loken was among the last standing Dwarven Generals when the Dryder Queen was defeated. Beyond most peoples memory, Loken has re-emerged from his retirement as a great Foe threatens Stonewood once again that has the potential to rival that of the Underdark War…. But there is one problem… Loken shouldn’t be in as good of health as he is…

Outcomes:
  - Loken will enter the tavern and question the adventures about Mayor Durag and his vile deeds. He will attempt to push the adventurers into action and bolster morale of the people in Stonewood from this bowing down that was “agreed upon” He will promise to “set the Mayor” straight on Saturday…
  - The PCs will reject Lokens push for assistance in dealing with the Mayor as they might feel he would destabilize the Town further.

  Rumor Circulating the Town

  “A Dwarf with the likeness of one of Stonewoods original heroes has been seen around town. Though his clothing and weapons may have changed, there is no mistaking his Red beard and his helmet. His voice inspires courage and confidence in those around him. Though he was thought to be long dead or moved onto Golden Halls, Loken Oakrider was his name. If this really is Loken, then the Bloody Fist are in for a world of pain!”

 	RRunning Notes: This is a purely RP module introducing a character intertwined into the Bloody Fist plot and the Hoylean-Murumbrian Time War plot. Lokens purpose is to unite the people of Stonewood and remove Mayor Durag by any means necessary as he has foreseen the downfall of Stonewood if Mayor Durag is not removed before Vel’Kaz the Ruthless arrives to town. Loken has a set of hidden powers linked to Time that he wont reveal unless things are getting to out of hand and it risks making the timeline worse by not intervining.
















































Rebirth of a Hero, Loken ”Bloodhammer” Oakrider
You aren't sure why you were pulled to this Timeline exactly of Stonewood but it is safe to assume the Hoylean-Murumbrian War that has been raging is the source. In your original timeline of Stonewood, you were a hero of the people, pure of heart and devout in your bloodlust of killing Orcs and the Underdark. Something is off about the leader of the Bloody Fist in this timeline but not Time related just off from when you faced the one you did before Time was broken in alternate Elysia. You will warn them of the hellish war that is coming and teach them how to survive.

Motivations: Aid Stonewood in restoration to its glory. Replace Mayor Durag “Lil Bristle”  if Hadukkel doesn’t oppose until the Bloody Fist are dealt with. Restore hope to the people of Stonewood by showing Dwarven strength and unity. Bolster their faith in Balor Ironleaf as a leader in these times as Loken knew his ancestor Faeloin

Transform: 9th Time Elemental (If he activates his Transform, Murumbrians or Hoyleans will show up hunting him shortly after so the PC have to risk it using his abilities if they ask him for help)
Background: Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider, a displaced hero from another timeline of Stonewood who slew their Warlord in an honor duel, re-emerges in Stonewood now due to the timeline being broken with Stonewood via Hoylean and Murumbrian invasion. Loken has an affinity for Time Magic but he is primarily a warrior. His visage is one of the faces in the Stonewood Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes. There was a Loken Oakrider of old in the very beginning of Stonewood but he has been long dead. The original Loken was a hero of a war with the Underdark. Seeing how he could fit in this timeline and help the people of Stonewood since this is his ancestral land, he has assumed the ID of Loken Oakrider as the “reborn” hero.
