  - Missing outcomes info. Missing props and costume into. Missing NPC contingency info.
  - If 4 of the 9 Taricsh NPCs are down the remaining 5 will flee? What if there are only 5 NPCs available?

  - May want to consider some sort of paralyze effect to be able to manage the encounter with less NPCs if too many PCs show up.

  - Why wouldn't one of the NPCs hold a knife to Granny's throat if more than Huldrek show up for the exchange? Make them think about how to use their skills to get the situation under control. Every encounter shouldn't be able to be resolved immediately by charging in and beating everyone down.

  - Is there a way for the players to flee if they are over-powered?
  - Is there any way to ensure that the box is brought to the encounter? The NPCs should have a chance to grab it back. Consider adding in the ransom note that if they do not see the box when "Huldrek" shows up, Granny will be killed immediately. 
  - What if the players just send Huldrek to the encounter and return the treasure? Will Granny be sent home? What will happen to Huldrek?
