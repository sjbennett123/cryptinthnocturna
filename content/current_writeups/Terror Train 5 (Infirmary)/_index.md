synopsis: The Infirmary was normally used to treat mundane injuries that you cannot heal by magic means for the Order of Oblivion’s Edge. The network of checks and balances of security in Moutesque is normally very tight and seamless. But Demitri Revendreth found a way to ruin all of these years of careful planning.
