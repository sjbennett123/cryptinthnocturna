running_notes: This module will scale in its difficulty with how the players engage the Mausoleum itself. Floor 1 is Jumping Spiders, Floor 2 is Deep Trolls, Floor 3 is the real challenge with Black Unicorns. Be careful with your PC group you pull for this about Floor 3 since the Black Unicorns have 3 Spellstrike Death’s and can deliver their 4 block as Magic. When the players defeated Floor 3, have them search for a lever setup in the Mod Shack. Once the lever is engaged, have them exit and turn out as much lighting as possible. The NPCs will start out sleeping as the Mountain Giants, they can stealth in and take the shard of foereaver and leave if they choose or fight the Giants. If they grab the Shard and run, they can escape. If they choose to engage they will receive the Magic Item Ring of the Champion from of the 5 Giants. This room is paying homage to the final fight where Faeolin Ironleaf fell fighting the True Giant that made him succumb to his wounds

rumors: |
  “Adventurers, I have had a vision, Foereaver called out to me…. I know where a piece of it is being kept that isnt in the hand of the Bloody Fist. Come ask me after the Mausoleum is reopened on the second day of the market this gather… I can give you its location but i won't post it here cause the Bloody Fist might try to intercept. This weapon is something they fear, that is all I can say…”
