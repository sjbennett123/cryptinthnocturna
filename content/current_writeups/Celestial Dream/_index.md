running_notes: This is overflow from May plotline finishing and National lead-in. This module is a break in the heaviness of task that is Moutesque and The Feral. Ideally this module happens around Lunchtime or just after so all can rest and hydrate. National and Local Plot decisions will be made during this conversation/discussion. Following this Module will be a Personal Plot hop to Stonewood and then a chain of Modules to reclaim Moutesque, essentially the calm before the storm so to speak =)
