description: A sweet talking, silver-tongued gambler/ merchant has come to town to trade and find a good card game.
synopsis:  The Master takes great pleasure from walking among the masses, his actual personality hidden. He is loved by most, but liked by all.. He exchanges currency, has a stock of potions, gasses, scrolls, and components he will sell for a fair coin, and will buy your trinkets at a good price.

Running_Notes:
  - At no time should the Master ever, ever, ever reveal his actual persona. The Master's cruel ways should never be reviled. Even the name “The Master” is forbidden.
  - The Master should be super easy to like. A guy you would want to hang out with. A good ol' boy.
  - He should gamble, and be a good sport. Throw a hand or two if necessary to keep people happy.
  - The prices set for goods are kingdom standard +3. In negotiation, you shouldn't go less than 3 of whatever value. For example, you are selling a potion. Kingdom standard is 5 gold. You have them listed for 8 gold, and will negotiate down to 5 gold. Going lower than kingdom is discouraged.
