Stonewood Townsfolk

·    These townsfolk are played across the course of the weekend

·    5 important ones will be present during the opening module and opening night roleplay modules

·    A Human fortuneteller will be in town on Saturday as a active roleplay encounter to hand out plot hints and entertainment

·    The citizens of Stonewood are content but broken under occupation of the Bloody Fist

o  They haven’t been killed or executed since the beginning of the occupation. This past 6 months have been very peaceful and almost normal.

o  A group of adventurers attempted to free the Town of Stonewood 1 year ago alongside Balor Ironleaf using the alias Black Leaf but were ultimately slaughtered and occupation continued. 

·    Talk about the good times before the occupation once you are warming up with the townsfolk and seem them actually having a winning shot at this

·    You will be very skeptical of outsiders marching in saying they will save you the first time since you watched it happen one year ago.

·    These encounters are meant to be played for the majority of the weekend and may be killed in dramatic fashion for plot points and modules



Balor Ironleaf, former Captain of the Black Anvil Company in Stonewood

 

*You were once the protector of this town. Now in your olden age you are not the Dwarf you once were. Before you would have died before these filthy Bloody Fist scum plagued your walls. But your life has been hard since the occupation set in and the execution of the Black Anvil Company, more importantly the grim executions of you friends.*



 

 

·    Balor is a gruff old grumpy Dwarf but a very honorable one

·    He has seen more battles with the monsters of Elysia than he cares to remember

·    You can always get him to talk about his glory days over a nice warm pint

·    He is very protective of Stonewood, this occupation is a literal living hell for him. He wants to liberate the town badly, but his spirits have been crushed this last year

·    Depending how the PCs interact with him, he will start to open up about rebellion or laugh at their dreams of liberating the town of Stonewood

·    No one knows the town of Stonewood better than Balor, he keeps tabs on everyone for the greater good of the town

·    He won’t carry any weapons actively so he can respect the Accords of the Fist but he keeps spells hidden on himself to aid the Citizens when the Bloody Fist are brutal to them

·    Balor will be used as a very common hook and rumor character to keep the players in the loop

·    If the town is restored after the first event Balor’s satisfaction, he will reinstate the Black Anvil Company as the new Town Guard for Stonewood with he PCs support

·

Motivations: All you care about is getting the Town of Stonewood back together again from the Bloody Fist. You age and wounds make it hard to fight and move anymore but you kept this town safe for many moons. You will aid the adventurers with the 10 buildings that must be reclaimed to get the town back in control and away from the Bloody Fists schemes

Mayor Anak “Lil Bristle” Durag, The Installed Mayor of Stonewood

*You have been left in charge by orcs due to your docile nature and your lack of drive. You work to ensure that the populace complies with the Accords of the Fist and work with the orcs take care of any problems. This arrangement has worked out pretty well for you, leading to you having a very nice home outside of town and a position of power that you never would have had under more normal circumstances.*

·    Demand Obediance - Demand that any outsiders that arrive follow the rules of the occupation. Reference how safe things are with the Changed Ones patrolling.

·    Rude - Whenever anyone is talking cut them off. Don't let them get in a word edgewise when they are speaking ot you. Walk away when you feel you have "won" the conversation.

·    Cowardly - If you are actually threatened in a meaningful way attempt to run. If that fails attempt to plead. if that fails cry. You got to this place by your cowardice and if pressed that cowardice will come through

·    Shaved Beard - You have had your beard shaved by the orcs because they think it's funny. They call you "Lil'Bristle" and laugh about it. You don't think it's very funny but you laugh along

·    Your best friend is Thorum Fairoak the town drunk

o  You guys go way back to when he ran his Jeweler Shop “Thorums Emporium”

o  You will do anything for this guy!

o  He got you out of a lot of trouble when the Bloody Fist took over Stonewood. He knows you aren’t the best choice for Mayor but he talks you up saying you are doing ‘the best you can” and it has worked thus far

·    When the players show up to confront the Chosen Ones, you will do ANYTHING to talk them out of engaging them!

o  Beg them to lay down their arms and just follow the Accords of the Fist

o  You don’t want any trouble with adventures because of how you sold them out last time to the Bloody Fist and they almost hung you for it

Weapons: a Copy of the Accords of the Fist

Race: Stonewood Dwarf

Costuming: NO DWARF BEARD (it was shaved as an insult and sign of your submission), Cane/Walking Stick, Hat, Noble Clothing



Thorum Fairoak, Town Drunk and Doomsayer

*You are such a miserable and greedy Dwarf it cost you everything. Your inheritance was wasted on gambling and drinking. You were once a great jeweler of the days of old. No one could find a gem and care for it like Thorum Fairoak. One day you bet it all on a game of dice and lost everything. You never found out that the game was rigged from the start but out of fear of blackmail for your failing you were force into silence. Many years have passed by this time, but you don’t care about that life anymore. Only thing that suits you now is a pint of brew and starting at the ladies, maybe a roll of the dice here and there.*

·    Think of the most negative person you know and make them a Dwarf, that is Thorum Fairoak.

·    This Dwarf cannot see the good in anything not involving Brews or Gambling. He used to be able to identify any gem or ore at a distance but that isn’t a skill he cares for now.

·    Make sure you talk about how you think the best thing that has happened to Stonewood is the occupation! It makes shady people like you not so bad in the grand scheme.

o  If pressed on this topic: explain that it doesn’t matter who “owns” or “runs” the town cause they all are corrupt at the core and selfish.

·    You are about the ONLY person in Stonewood who still fully trusts Mayor Anak Durag. He used to be your best friend when you ran “Thorums Emporium” 10 years ago but that is all down the drain. 

o  Anak has your back when people try to toss you out or silence you but you know he is a coward with a big title so you will sing his praises to everyone.

o  To be fair Anak has worked out a “livable” treaty with the Bloody Fist where they don’t kill you, they supply you with basic food and drink, and will protect you from outside threats if you simply follow the Accord of the Fist

·    If the PCs try to talk you into rebellion call them crazy and tell them the Bloody Fist will slaughter, you all. Drive home the point that they will start executing people by the dozens if the treaty is broke again

·    Be very loud and obnoxious! You are the town drunk and you let people know your opinion on EVERYTHING 

·    Tell everyone you will just leave town and doom will set in on them if they fight the Bloody Fist

 

Body 15

Weapons: none

Race: Stonewood Dwarf

Ari-ellea Startear, Town Librarian

*You were once the adopted daughter of a noble Dwarf in Stonewood, Lozzuik Forgehand. Lozzuik was killed before your eyes when the Bloody Fist came the first time. You were so young then and couldn’t believe the act. You were rescued from the streets after being orphaned 10 years ago. The only comfort you find left in the world is reading the books you write and collect. You typically keep your head down and avoid conflict but this time you are hopeful for a change but fearful of the massacre*

·    You know firsthand the brutality of the Bloody fist when they cut down Lozzuik Forgehand, your savior, right before you and made you watch. His crime was merely asking why he couldn’t have more food to feed his family. There was a fistfight, and they drug him into the street and beheaded him. This haunts you to this day

·    You love to talk about the land of Woodhaven and town of Stonewood. Not much has been coming in terms of gossip since the Bloody Fist have taken over, but no real problems either. The Bloody Fist are efficient to handle any threats to them and you know that.

·    If ask, you will tell people that it isn’t so bad living under the Bloody Fists rule now. Traumatized from Lozzuik’s death, but you have gained strength in your pain over time. You can normally advocate for the occupation to continue since you prefer not to carry a weapon and have the Bloody Fist defend you. 

o  The Chosen Ones fascinate you. They were once Hoylean Dwarves who traded books with you, but they were consumed by greed like most are. 

o  You feel bad for them and will try and convince the players to not kill them as they are great guardians who don’t require sleep. They patrol 24/7

o  You feel they are fulfilling a destiny with Hoyle they always wanted to and should be left to do so

·    People with weapons make you nervous, so if PCs approach you with weapons in hand back away from them

·    Having no real ability to defend yourself, you will flee at the first sight of conflict.

·    You generally keep to yourself but the hopefulness of avenging Lozzuik’s death with these new adventurers can’t be shaken

·    You don’t like loud people so avoid talking to large groups or loud PCs, insist you move somewhere quiet

·    You feel the Mayor Anak Durag has your best interests at heart but you don’t trust he isn’t corrupted

o  You will admit it is a little funny the Orcs call him “lil Bristle” since he is a coward

 

Body: 10

Weapons: none

Costuming: Elf Ears, Commoners clothing, cloak, book/tomb, glasses

Haddix “Brow-splitter” Strongbow, former mercenary and stable hand

*You used to be the best damn archer Stonewood had ever seen! You could hit anything as far as the bow could draw and the eye could see. Your legend in battle was sung in the halls of Stonewood as a Master Marksman for decades. But that all changed when the cursed Bloody Fist showed up. You took out a Blood Fist Raid Leader in one shot and they took your Bow String Hand for it! Healers tried to restore it, but it was some Chaos Tainted dagger used in the ritual to severe it, preventing its regrowth. Now you have a humble but depressing job as a Stable Hand.*

·    You HATE the Bloody Fist with a burning passion. They killed your childhood best friend Sorin LongOak the same day they severed your hand. Your friend died a hero saving people from the Bloody Fist but you were overwhelmed.

·    Talk about the “endless horde” the Bloody Fist have at their disposal. No one has ever been able to put a number on it. But these bastards seem to breed like rabbits! 

o  No one has every seen the full Bloody Fist size at once but you saw the best view when you were captured and your hand severed. The number by your count was close to a thousand if you had to guess.

o  You are the only person beside Mayor Anak who has seen their leader “Ahroun the Hope Flayer” otherwise known as Warlord Ahroun

o  The best description you could give them is *“He stands tall like a tree, covered in animal furs and a Wolves head on his, burning Orange Eyes like the embers of a fire, 2 large blades on his back that could fell Giants, his very stare strikes fear in your heart and makes you question what It means to be called a warrior…”*

·    You will cling to any hope you can that the Bloody Fist will be toppled! You will offer to help in anyway you can in secret.

·    You are terribly depressed that your Bow String Hand was taken, and you were left useless to fight. You would have rather died but they left you alive to suffer to their delight. Each time you consider starting a fight to try to end it all at their blades in battle, hope clings to you and your friend Sorin’s memory to stay in this fight and see them defeated.

·    When the players enter town on Friday, greet them with sheer happiness when they are fighting or have defeated the Chosen Ones. You couldn’t stand to see Hoylean Dwarves suffer slavery at the hands of the Bloody Fist

·    You HATE Mayor Anak! You want this man gone and beaten for his crimes against your people in Stonewood. Any Dwarf of noble birth would have spit in the face of their oppressors and died on their feet before agreeing to the terms he did

 

Body: 30

Weapons: None, you got 1 hand anyways

Costuming: Dwarf beard, wrap your right hand in cloth to show it is severed, Cloak, commoners clothing, a toolbelt, anything related to taking care of a stable

 

Durmac Leafdancer, former Towns Guard of Stonewood, now Mayors Aide

*You used to be a proud Town Guard of Stonewood but the Bloody Fist stripped you of your job! You were a Dwarf of common birth, but your deeds earned you a place on the guard. You never were the best in a fight, but your skills with words earned you respect among your comrades. Mayor Anak felt awful your job was erased by the Bloody Fist via the Accords, so as compensation he made you his personal aide to the Town of Stonewood which you have conflicted views on but its better than being broke.*

·    You got stuck in an entry level job with a massive glass ceiling. Your boss, Mayor Anak is a total jerk and not the most liked person, but it pays the bills and the Bloody Fist don’t bother you so its “ok” living

·    You don’t hate the Bloody Fist with a burning passion like you used to when the Town Guard was dismantled at first. But you certainly have no real love for them.

o  As a former guard you respect their position as protectors of Stonewood in a way.

o  It is hard to explain but you justify it in your head, and it makes sense to you why it is comfortable. Mostly because you weren’t the best fighter, you preferred words to the blade.

o  You don’t like how brutal they are when they execute punishments. There is no grey area with the Bloody Fist. You either obey or you pay, normally with your life but they can be reasoned with for components and gold piles

·    You CANNOT STAND Mayor Anak’s best friend Thorum! You think he is such and idiot and more of a coward than Anak is. The man was set for life, and he rolled it all away on dice when he could have taken over a jewelry empire in Stonewood. You only tolerate him cause the Mayor loves this man, but if the Bloody Fist cut his tongue out you would buy them a drink on you.

·    When the players enter the town on Friday night, meet them with Mayor Anak in the road and try to convince them to leave Stonewood! You don’t want any trouble and the Bloody Fist would surely crush them like they did the last 

o  Try to convince them that life is good under the Accords of the Fist!

o  Hand the players a copy of the Accords of the Fist and beg them to read it out to the others to see reason

o  Whatever offers the mayor makes, up the ante if they PCs don’t accept it. You probably can’t make them come true but by morning the Bloody Fist will be here and can handle the players themselves

·    You secretly want the Bloody Fist gone as well but you don’t have the heart to fight them or risk the whole towns lives to go back to being a poor excuse for a Town Guard in Stonewood.

·    This NPC can be swayed to either side by the PCs with interactions

Body: 20

Weapons: none

Costuming: Dwarf Beard, Noble Clothing, a book with feathered Quill to take notes, a sash worn over your shoulder and across your body, Eyepatch or fabric over one eye to show it is gone, copy of the Accords of the Fist

Meredith “Veil-Piercer” Wolfsbane

*You were once an avid Adventurer known for your hunting of Werewolves and Vampires. But an injury you sustained on a rather vicious hunt left you unable to continue your life of fighting the creatures of the night. Though with this injury came the gift of prophecy. You now travel Woodhaven attempting to divine the fortunes of adventurers for a coin to make a living. Sometimes the readings are nothing more than filling them with hope, but sometimes they are terrifying possessions from beyond the Veil of this realm and into the unknown…*

·    When reading a PCs fortune, ask lots of questions about their past. The bigger the responses from the player, engage them with a dark prophecy. These will be unique descriptive phrases given by plot to hint at events to come

 When the dark prophecies take over:

o  Touch the players arm and close your eyes. Start to mutter nonsense to yourself and open your eyes dramatically. Change your voice to much deeper and distort it so it sounds like someone else talking

o  To the most engaged players who you give readings to, hand out the following Dark Prophecies:

§ “*I see the Town of Stonewood ablaze, Orcish laughter echoes as you hear your friends screaming for help. Nothing can save you from the pain that is coming. Embers are already lit but they will raise to bonfires after sunset”*

§ *I see a mausoleum, dark, cold, and filled with life. But the life is not recent life, this life has been forcible brought back against its will and it is FURIOUS to be here. You must cease it before it gives into hatred”*

§ *“I see 3 dead bodies laying at the foot of Bloody Fist assassins, they have crossed over spiritually but their bodies are here forever, the smell of sulfur is potent in the air, the town is falling apart, and you didn’t save them in time”*

§ *“I see clouds of green mist, smoke, decay, and hear hideous laughter echoing as your cling to your consciousness and breathe. The room is shrinking by the second as well”*

§ *“I see the shadows are animating, they dance to life and are looking for something or someone. They are incredible angry and determined”*

·    If you read the fortune of the “chosen one” (ask Plot to tell you who) when you grab their arm to tell them the dark prophecy, Scream and pass out for a minute on the table. You mind is overwhelmed by a horrific nightmare they have been experiencing for weeks now:

o  *The dream begins with you being held cradled like a baby by a gigantic figure in dark robes. Held close to it’s chest you cannot see it’s face. You are not comforted by this action despite the apparent kindness of the gesture. The figure’s skin is cold and it’s movement is stiff and emotionless. A cold purple light pervades the room glowing in intensity then you wake up. When you wake up you are covered in sweat and cannot shake the feeling of doom.*
