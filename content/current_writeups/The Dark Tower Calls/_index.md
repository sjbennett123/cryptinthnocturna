  “This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinth. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinth. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinth as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.”

  ~Kyumiri Cryptinth, High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth

running_notes: This module is the introduction to the High Archon Solomon Zeneth of Oblivions Edge. He will give them a very deep understanding of the threat they are facing with Moutesque. He will tell them what he knows of the Chaotic One, the Green Star over Moutesque, Demitri Revendreth, and what he suspects the deal is with the Feral being manipulated by either Demitri or the Green Eyed Demon
