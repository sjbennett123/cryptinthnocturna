**Flee Point**: Site Wide Raid

**Running Notes**: This module is designed as a follow-up to the morning raid module Hold Back the Day. Very similar in its implantation but more aggressive in nature. The Bloody Fist have been fighting since the break of dawn with both victories and losses so their demeanor is a bit more aggressive and fierce now with the deaths of their brothers and sisters. The NPCs should surround the Tavern and draw the PCs out and divide them into smaller teams and draw them away from a mass battle, go hunting at cabins, lurk on woodlines to draw people out to capture them. The Bloody Fist want to kill them but seeing them tortured by Bonesaw is more pleasing to these cruel Orcs cause they are Vel’Kaz’s division and they are all about fear and terror. Banter with the players and challenge them to combat, call them cowards for hiding in their tavern, do ANYTHING you can to get them outside the walls that keep them safe. Tell stories about how you have citizens tied up in the woods to exchange for their lives.
