## Whispering Wind
Level: 2
Target: Spirit
Duration: One message
Components: P2, E1, S1, V1

This formal magic causes a message to be delivered on the wind to anyone who meets the following conditions: 
  - that person has a spirit
  - the caster has met them, 
  - they are not permanently dead
  - they are presently on this plane of existence.

The wind will carry the message to the recipient where only he will be able to hear it. The recipient may choose to ignore any whispering wind that comes to him/her. The recipient will be aware of the identity of the message sender.

The message is limited to fve words plus one word per level of formal magic ability possessed by the caster.

The time for the message to be delivered varies. Certain eﬀects and ﬂuctuations of magic may prevent the message from being delivered. The marshal is responsible for delivering the message or fnding an NPC to deliver the message. The message will take as long to deliver as it takes for the formal magic marshal or the designated NPC to fnd the recipient. If the recipient is not on site the message delivery will obviously be delayed. The time allowed for delivery of the message is 2 hours or the formal magic will fail; this time limit is extendable by the plot commitee. This formal magic may not be used for communication between chapters without prior agreement between the staﬀ/plot commitees of both chapters. If communication between chapters is atempted, the player may be responsible for obtaining such agreements.
