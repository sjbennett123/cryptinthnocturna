description: Demitri Revendreth has obtained a one time access key to the Tower from an entity known as “The Chaotic One” At Midnight he plans a ritual to crack the barrier of the Tower just long enough to let one soul escape to seal the deal he made.

synopsis: >
  Demitri Revendreth has a one time access key for a very specific soul that The Chaotic One is looking for. When the ritual begin on the Dark Tower, Solomon Zeneth sends a Whispering Wind to multiple PCs,  Little do the players know Demitri has begun 2 rituals, one targeting the Dark Tower with the intention of Backlashing it as a means to Super Charge the One Time Access Key. 
  As the players approach, they will hear “RITUAL COMPLETE” and feel the Dark Tower come to life. Demitri Revendreth, The Prince of North March, under the One True King Valdrick, attempts to open the Dark Tower of Moutesque as per his deal with The Chaotic One. Demitri is not fully aware of the power he toys with. The One Time Access Key is a one way ticket for a Single Soul to be let out. Demitri has been a pawn of The Chaotic One for a few years now fighting a shadow war he didn’t care to wage. As the players approach the Mod Shack, the mod marshal will call “RITUAL COMPLETE” and then a HOLD will be called to read the section 
outcomes: 
  - The PCs are able to destroy Demitri Revendreth and Stake Him 5 Times
  - The PCs stop Demitri Revendreth but haven’t acquired enough Stakes to Perm him
  - The PCs make a deal for Demitri Revendreth to leave now that his purpose is complete, unknowing to them that his “escape” will mean they face him in July.

rumors: |
  As of last night and into this morning, we have encountered some roaming Undead in the forest around Cryptinith and near Moutesque. We have sent message to the mages who reside in Moutesque to hear any reports they have left but we aren’t hopefull for a response. One of the Undead had the Order who protects Moutesque attire on so we fear the worse. We will increase our patrols and send Hakkens Blade into the forest to cut down all wretched Undead we find.  This Friday can’t come soon enough. I want to find out the happenings in Moutesque. Safe travels to Crypinth heroes.
