title: Ritual Complete
---


As the ritual completes, thunder rumbles and lightning strikes where the door of the Dark Tower would be, a loud unholy hiss cries out as a large black spirit races to the outside. Before the Dark Tower's magic can reseal it, the large black spirit escapes the walls and erupts in green flame, splitting it into 4 smaller souls that scatter like shooting stars. The Dark Towerâ€™s barrier is complete again, but evil laughter and a cold chill goes down your spine hearing the rattling of bone from within the Antechamber.
