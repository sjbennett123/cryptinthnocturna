-An Order of Mages known as “Oblivion's Edge”  guard the Dark Tower. This order was established as a Ducal Order but their notoriety has been cast into the shadows purposely to avoid the every watchful eyes of evil forces
-The city looks completely empty because of the magics over it, under the surface the town is well kept and not in disarray. Citizens don't appear to stay in the city proper just on the outskirts.
-All the Mages who oversaw the Dark Tower’s protection have been systematically killed over the last 3 years in secret. When the Crystal Barrier went up, a sizeable contingent of Valdrick’s forces were left here in Simoondale. A Master Vampire named Demitri Revendreth was in-charge of the legion who was trapped. Under his cruel and wicked mind, Demitri waged war on the Dark Tower in secret with the Mages. He intercepted all forms of correspondence they attempted to send to the Duke for aid, essentially locking them into a helpless silent war. In the end they all fell to Dimitri’s tactics, but even as Greater Undead he could not Vampire Charm the secrets of the tower out of them due to a Mystical Force within the mages. Demitri is working with someone known as “The Chaotic One” or the “Green-Eyed Demon” in payment for their return to Valdrick upon access to the Dark Tower
-The remaining Mage of Oblivions Edge is a Human by the name of Solomon Zeneth, High Archon of Oblivion's Edge. Solomon has been at this war for nearly 3 years now defending Montesque from an Undead Horde.
