description: A child is taken from in front of his parents. The father chases the group to a cave out of town. He has returned to try to find help in retrieving his child.
synopsis:   |
  A child is taken from right in front of his home, in front of his parents. The father chases after the group to a cave outside of the town. The father says he saw only three take his boy, but he didn't enter the cave, and had no way to fight the abductors. He needs and begs for help in rescuing his son.
  The father will deny any wrong doing. He saw nothing out of the ordinary before his boy was taken. If the right line of questions are asked, the father will admit to not paying his tithe on time and being in default when Stonewood was freed.
