Kysol Aszeel the Wizard of Vengeance and Vilification lead a noble court called Northumberland. 15 Years ago Kysol was obliterated and exiled, upon his death he transformed into a Master Werewolf and fled to his liege's home and bit a large amount of people making an Army of Lycans to dissuade anyone from hunting him.

Now while Kysol is technically the Alpha (leader) of the Feral, no one has seen him in years. Many fear he still lurks in the wilds of Cryptinith. The Beta of the Feral, Ulrick Firepaw has been very active as of these past 2 months since the reports from Moutesque have stopped coming out. 

If the Feral catch any Lycans transformed after dark, they enact a ritual to sway them to their side and embrace their inner Lycan.
