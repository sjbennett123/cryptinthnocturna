Oh yeah, so you retired here and there was a bad guy that i guess was thermo and hadukl's nemesis named Crystal

This guy apparently just fucking once they obliterated him just fucking fled. And he ended up encrypted and he was a liken, he permanently transformed and he just bits as many people in the town as he could. He's like, if they're coming to the town for me, they're gonna find an army of fucking lightness.

Puzzle was notable and He was the worst sport i've ever encountered.

It was bad, dude. He was like, Just, He was one of those guys, that was really good at the game, but he was good at the game by being a douche about it.

Just called the? Uh, so we would like he was loosely affiliated with the gestures. But not really, he had his own team called Northumberland. Um,

And there they, they were really, they were good. But they, It was like a really exclusive crew, right? So as people stopped playing, did they get? They just kind of fizzled out.

Uh, i think donnie reached out to him, but i don't know if he ever responded. I think you wanted to get him to come back at some point to play that character. It's like a permanently transformed creature because that would be really cool.
