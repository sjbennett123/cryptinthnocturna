## Rumors:

[ANNOUNCED] There is a bounty on rats in the city, and the city will pay one silver for every  rat tail harvested.
[COMMON] A symbol has been sighted at gristly crimes. Usually drawn in blood on the forehead of the slain and tortured, it has been likened to a shepherd's crook.
[COMMON] Large packs of giant rats have been seen roaming around the city. They are drawn by garbage and decay, and are large enough colonies to cause a problem for lone or small groups of travelers.


â€‹	

Non-Standard Effects: GIANT FIELD RAT can heal to full body TWICE on a TEN count [One I feed, Two I feed, etc.]

## Rules Clarification: 

Each Rat, when killed, will give a rat tail for the bounty. These are in game items.
