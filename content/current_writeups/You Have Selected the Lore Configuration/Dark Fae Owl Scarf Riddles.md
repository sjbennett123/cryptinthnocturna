Dark Fae Owl Scarf Riddles (Personal Plot Item for Adira)

The Black Scarf with the Silver Owl will call to Adira the second the Cave is opened. If she solves the Riddles of the Scarf, the Scarf will bind itself to her and she will feel the embrace of the Dark/Shadow Fae Court. A presence she knows the feeling of but not the name of the creature that reaches out to her (He is known as “the Cold One”). This begins her Dark Fae transform plotline

6 Riddles Adira will have to solve to gain access to the scarf. If she completes them the Scarf is hers and her connection to the Dark Fae entity known as “the Cold One” is complete.  If she doesn’t complete them or gives up, the scarf will vanish but she will be told she will be tested soon again...
