description: There is a cave in the forest Cryptinith that the Star of Nekron has found and will sell its location for 50g. Inside the cave is rumored to be great treasure locked behind a door that only the sharpest minds can open.
synopsis:   > 
  Speaker Issac comes to town with knowledge of a cave that holds great treasure inside such as Magic Items and other loot behind the door if they can crack the code. The Speaker is willing to sell the location to the cave for 50 gold but warns the PCs that only the sharpest minds will be able to break the puzzles and riddles to gain access to all of the riches. There is rumor that someone with an a Kin to Fae knowledge or affinity would be good to have along for a “Labyrinthian Mind”. 
  Inside the cave are 8 “brain puzzles” to open the door. There is a box with the treasure the cave contains.  Hanging from something will be a black scarf with silver metal clasps and a silver owl with black eyes. The scarf calls out to Adira, this is the beginning of her personal plotline quest for a Transform to Dark Fae. She will have 6 riddles to complete, if she gets them then the Scarf will bind itself to her and “the Cold One” will reach out to her at a later time to continue her training.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs pay 50g and head to the Cave to test their Minds on the riddles and Puzzles for treasure
  - The PCs tell Issac they aren’t interested in paying 50g for a gamble on the Cave
  - If Adira completes the riddles the Scarf is hers and her connection to the Dark Fae entity known as “the Cold One” is complete.  
  - If Adira doesn’t complete the riddles or gives up, the scarf will vanish but she will be told she will be tested soon again...
