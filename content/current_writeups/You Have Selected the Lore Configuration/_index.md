 Running Notes: This module is a massive puzzle module. The PCs will be offered knowledge of a Cave with “great treasures” aka a Magic Item and other loot behind the door if they can crack the code.

There will be a box with the treasure the Cave contains, but hanging from something will be a black Scarf with Silver Metal clasps and a Silver Owl with Black Eyes. The Scarf will call out to Adira, this is the beginning of her Personal Plotline quest for a Transform to Dark Fae.

Dark Fae Owl Scarf Riddles (Personal Plot Item for Adira)

The Black Scarf with the Silver Owl will call to Adira the second the Cave is opened. If she solves the Riddles of the Scarf, the Scarf will bind itself to her and she will feel the embrace of the Dark/Shadow Fae Court. A presence she knows the feeling of but not the name of the creature that reaches out to her (He is known as “the Cold One”). This begins her Dark Fae transform plotline

6 Riddles Adira will have to solver to gain access to the Scarf. If she completes them the Scarf is hers and her connection to the Dark Fae entity known as “the Cold One” If she doesn’t not complete them or give up, the scarf will vanish but she will be told she will be tested soon again
