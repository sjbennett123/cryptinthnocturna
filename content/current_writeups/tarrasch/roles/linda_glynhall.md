b
weight: 10
description: a long retired adventurer, is quite glad the occupatoin of Stonewood is over. Having spent the summer under brutal occupation and the long winter just trying to survive, this spring brings with it a renewed vigor that can only come from a newfound freedom. “Granny”, hearing that the adventurer's would be returning to Stonewood, has decided to bake up a delicious batch of cookies as a thank you. Only one problem, her recipe book has gone missing!
introduction: > 
  Oh dear! Look at you! What a lovely sweater! Are you hungry? Thirsty? Need a healing? Granny's here to help!” At the tender young age of 90, Granny is a lovely, squat, old figure in the local community. She has never met a stranger, and welcome all who come to her door!
  When the occupation happened, Granny kept her head down and did as she was told. She allowed her neighbors to “teach Charlie a lesson”, even though it hurt her to know what he had to go through. He was bound to be caught by the Bloody Fist and killed, and possibly Granny Linda along with him.
Motivation: She wants her book back. And she wants someone to find her grandson Charlie. She is willing to share information to achieve those goals.
Costume: Silver or gray wig, tied up into a bun. A very well kept beard with braids and ribbons. Apron and floral dress, with a dusting of flour. She smells like cookies.
Magic: 6 Earth Block
