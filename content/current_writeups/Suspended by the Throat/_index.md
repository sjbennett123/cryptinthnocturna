description: A groundskeeper heard unnatural noises coming from a Catacomb just outside Moutesque. A servant of Demitri Revendreth has risen dead Feral and must be stopped!
synopsis: > 
  A concerned Groundskeeper comes to the tavern to seek the aid of the PCs to clear out a Catabcomb he is certain a servant of Demitri Revendreath has been working evil magic in. He heard the sounds of Feral Howls but he heard the moans and wails the Undead make when they move among this world when they are risen again. The PCs should move with haste to catch them during the day trapped in the Catacomb before they can be released at night to roam freely and spread the plague.

  A Servant of Demitri Revendreth has done something unthinkable and gathered Feral dead corpses and created them as Greater Undead to amplify their power. When the PCs arrive, they will hear snarls and howls mixed with the moans and wails of Undead. Whomever did this abomination lurked around collecting all the dead Feral slain after the PCs killed them over the last night. There is no easy way to approach this module than rushing in and facing them. There is only one wave of these creatures, this was a cruel experiment that was to be released at night but the PCs lucked out and have a chance to stop it now.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs enter the Catacomb and slay the Undead Lycans
  - The PCs ignore the fight or donâ€™t defeat them and the undead Lycans become a Night Random (detailed in the modulec)
