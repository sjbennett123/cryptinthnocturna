description: > 
  A local merchant in Cryptinith has been shorted on a trade deal. The matter was brought to the Lord Reeve and he was headed to deal with it but now that there are adventurers, a test of their persuasion and investigation is called.

synopsis: The Lord Reeve of Cyptinith, Kyumiri Cryptinth,  sets out to the Tavern. Before he arrives, a last group of Feral snuck into the City Gates and sensed the Lycans among the Adventurers in the Tavern. The Feral “randoms” set out for them as Kyumiri makes his grand appearance cutting a path through them to reach the adventurers. Upon his arrival and the dispatching of the Feral, the High Lord Reeve welcomes the Adventurers and give them 2 tasks to judge their skills before setting out for Moutesque.

  The nature of the trade dispute is a shipment of Silver Ore and Alchemy to Corin Stellin, a local independent trader and merchant. Orden Dutah, an experienced businessman, feels Corin is taking advantage of the Guilds hospitality allowing him to be an independent  free trader operating outside the “rules of the guilds.” Corin is upset over the taxes the Guilds charge for silver imports given the nature of Lycans and the Laws of Cryptinth. Corin doesn’t feel the taxes should apply in this dire need. Orden wants to collect the Guilds tax on Corin despite his good intentions.

  The Lord Reeve doesn’t like to get involved with he Guilds unless he has too, this keeps his mind focused on the task of protecting the Town. The Lord Reeve wants the PCs to resolve this task for him to see how they navigate a new lands diplomacy. 

outcomes:
 - Corin will pay them 30 Gold if he gets his way. The “correct” resolution is to allow Corin to evade the taxes,
 - Orden will only pay them 15 Gold if he gets his way. The players can gain favor and “aid” from Orden if they take his side and lesser coin offer. 
  - The PCs head to deal with the Feral Pack that captured citizens (Test Your Might) and come back to deal with this later.

  This module is the introduction to the High Lord Reeve Kyumiri Cryptinth, it begins with a small skirmish with Feral and ends with a Roleplay encounter welcoming the Adventurers to Cryptinth. Kyurmiri will give them 2 tasks to judge their abilities to handle Moutesque. The First is a Trade Dispute and a test of their diplomatic and reasoning skills. The Second module will be a Test of Might. These two modules will go off back to back depending on which path they choose to go first
