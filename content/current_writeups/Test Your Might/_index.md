description: A Feral pack has captured a few citizens of Cryptinith just before Dusk on their way back into the gates. If they are not rescued they will be eaten alive as a sacrifice to their “Alpha” The Lord Reeve, Kymiru Cryptinith, asks for help
synopsis: > 
  The Lord Reeve of Cyptinith has made it to the tavern and made his presence known. 2 tasks have been laid out before the adventurers. The First is a Trade Dispute and a test of their diplomatic and reasoning skills. The Second module is a Test of Might. These two modules will go off back to back depending on which path they choose to go first. 

  The High Lord Reeve Kyumiri leads the Adventurers who wish to free the citizens to the location he was given by his scouts in Hakkens Blade. When he gets near the location, Kyumiri offers to guard the path while the Adventurers enter the Cave and save the citizens. Should things get too out of hand, Kyumiri wont let the adventurers fall but he wont intervene unless its certain death. This is a test of their bravery and to see how they handle themselves in a smaller encounter vs a mass battle like the Feral prefer to capture in. The morality choice at the end of this module is COMPLETELY up to the PCs. 

outcomes: 
  - The PCs head to deal with the Feral Pack that captured citizens 
  - The PCs ignore the request and the citizens are eaten as a sacrifice to the “Alpha”

   “This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinth. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinth. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinth as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.”

   ~Kyumiri Cryptinth, High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth

  This module is the introduction to the High Lord Reeve Kyumiri Cryptinth, it begins with a small skirmish with Feral and ends with a Roleplay encounter welcoming the Adventurers to Cryptinth. Kyurmiri will give them 2 tasks to judge their abilities to handle Moutesque. 

  Kyumiri will take whatever they choose as the fate of the citizens if he is not involved in the battle. If the players fail and KYUMIRI gets involved by rescuing them, he will add a special level of guilt with any decision that is made. If Ghile takes Haldin under his wing, then Haldin could shift and get out of control and kill innocents. If Haldin is allowed to be slain for a “mercy” killing, Kyumiri will put the guilt on the players about an untested soul by the Beast and question their judgement.
