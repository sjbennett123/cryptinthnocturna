   “This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinth. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinth. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinth as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.”

   ~Kyumiri Cryptinth, High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth

hook: Kyumiri makes his appearance to aid the Adventurers. Once the Feral are dispatched, Kyumiri will begin his welcoming ritual and trial

  This module is the introduction to the High Lord Reeve Kyumiri Cryptinth, it begins with a small skirmish with Feral and ends with a Roleplay encounter welcoming the Adventurers to Cryptinth. Kyurmiri will give them 2 tasks to judge their abilities to handle Moutesque. The First is a Trade Dispute and a test of their diplomatic and reasoning skills. The Second module will be a Test of Might. These two modules will go off back to back depending on which path they choose to go first

  The High Lord Reeve Kyumiri will lead the Adventurers who wish to free the citizens to the location he was given by his scouts in Hakkens Blade. When he gets near the location, Kyumiri will offer to guard the path while the Adventurers enter the Cave and save the citizens. Should things get too out of hand, Kyumiri wont let them fall but he wont intervene unless its certain death. This is a test of their bravery and to see how they handle themselves in a smaller encounter vs a mass battle like the Feral prefer to capture in. The morality choice at the end of this module is COMPLETELY upto the PCs. Kyumiri will take whatever they choose as the fate of the citizens if he is not involved in the battle. If Kyumiri is involved he will take make the choice more difficult as he will add a level to guilt to the decisions and express the concerns for life and death.

  IF KYUMIRI is involved, he will add a special level of guilt to either choice. If Ghile takes him under his wing, then he could shift and get out of control and kill innocents. If Haldin is allowed to be slain for a “mercy” killing, Kyumiri will put the guilt on them about an untested soul by the Beast and question their judgement.  The final note is ONLY if Kyumiri is INVOLVED if the players fail and he has to rescue them
