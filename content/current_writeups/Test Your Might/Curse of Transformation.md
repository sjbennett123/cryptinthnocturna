title: curse of transformation
---

If the Feral bite you, they can inflict a Curse or Transformation on you based on their Lycan type.

**The trigger for the Curse of Transformation**: Outside the City Gates of Cryptinth after dark. 

There will be a siren played at dusk. If you are caught outside the City Gates you will be forced into a Berserker State as your Curse of Transformatoin comes tearing out. YOU WILL FIGHT EVERYTHING YOU SEE! The Calm spell will bring them out of the Berserker state but they are Immune to Awaken
