**Brief**: 5 Kindom warriors pass through town on the way to a crypt that they heard about. While they are town, they tell tales of the surrounding countryside before venturing into the crypt.


 **Requirements:** 

- Saturday Morning


**Synopsis**: A group of 5 Soldiers are following a rumor of a deadly undead crypt. They explain that they are hunting some high powered undead in the region but tell the PCs that they are well suited for this danger. They do not want any PCs to come with them, they are confident they can handle any issues that arise. They also refuse to stay to deal with the “Orc Situation” having undead to deal with which serve a far greater threat to the kingdom than some measly Orcs. 

**Outcomes**: 

1. After about an hour they depart for the fabled crypt to slay the Undead.


**Rumors**:

Deep in the Stonewood hills there is a Wretched Crypt with a sleeping undead. This undead is dangerous but not if you take the proper precautions. His weakness is simply the primary color, yellow. If you prominently wear this into his crypt and do not bring any perishable food, you will not wake him, and while he slumbers, he will fall quickly to your blade.

They are a jovial bunch and are kind and decent to the PCs. Use this as a chance for NPC’s to take a break from fighting and get some food, and socialize. 

The Knights are spending time in the town and need to give out a lot of lore about the setting. This is a chance to really describe the area beyond the town.
