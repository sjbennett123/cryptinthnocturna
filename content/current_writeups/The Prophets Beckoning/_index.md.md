synopsis: > 
  Solomon Zeneth send a concerning Whispering Wind to a player in town. He reveals the location of a Ritual Site he saw the Children of the Stars gathering at. But no followers were with them and the air was VERY Chaotic near the site. Solomon will impress upon them the URGENCY of this request to stop them ASAP from doing what they are planning…

running_notes: This module is the turning point in the Star of Nekron plotline. If they haven’t figured it out by now the Children of the Stars are NOT WHO THEY SAY! They are the Star of Nekron, they are most of the reason this is all happening. They are the Cult “The Chaotic One” assembled to power the Star of Nekron to imbue what he wants to release from the Dark Tower of Moutesque.
