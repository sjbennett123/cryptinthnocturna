Friends,

Another meeting of the Children of the Stars is at hand, this time they are conducting some sort of ritual to contact their patron spirit.

The Children of the Stars are NOT WHO THEY SAY! They are the Star of Nekron, they are most of the reason this is all happening. They are the Cult “The Chaotic One” assembled to power the Star of Nekron to imbue what he wants to release from the Dark Tower of Moutesque.
