The Star of Nekron

 

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**:  A new “cult” named the Star of Nekron sends one of their “Speakers” into town to distribute some pamphlets for their Midnight Meeting. The Children of the Stars are seeking new members to grow their ranks with “disillusioned” citizens on the Elysian Nobility over the last 3 years




 **Requirements:** A Lesson in Agony has been run

 

**Synopsis**: A “Speaker” of the “Children of the Stars” will come to town and pass out pamphlets about their meeting tonight. The contents will be a movement to “Strengthen Elysia” and have “representation for the disillusionment of nobility in the last 3 years” topics of “abandonment of the citizens” will be a hot button. The PCs will be invited to attend the meeting, this is completely optional to attend. If no one shows up, the meeting happens without a hitch, if PCs show up then a brief discussion about the “core values” will be discussed and see if they can garner any support from the PCs to the “cause.”

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs attend the meeting and hear out the Speaker

(2) the PCs ignore the invitation and the meeting happens off-screen

 

**Rumors:** “Last night as of 2 past the Witching Hour, a dark green glowing Star appeared over Moutesque and Cryptinth. We will begin research into what this Star means and where it came from but this is a very unnatural occurrence for our area…

 

~Kyumiri Cryptinth

![*](PicExportError)       **Running Notes**: This module is the introduction to the Star of Nekron cult for the Four Fiends of Elysia Plotline. The “Children of the Stars” as they call themselves, follow the Green Star of Hope which appeared over Moutesque and Cryptinth recently. Once enough faith in the “Green Star” has been raised, the Star of Nekron will appear in an area and collect all energy they siphon to the cause. The cultist will refer to the “Green Eyed One” as their patron “Spirit” that will return Elysia to “Balance” of pressed they will only utter the name “Krotis-Gul” The cover story they have is he was a Warrior of Elysia some almost 40 years ago who disappeared into the Fae Realm and has been seen recently as to return. It sounds like they are kinda crazy about their devotion in this hero but they are 100% in their belief in it. One of the blessings Krotis-Gul gives to his “true” followers is the Immunity to Charm and Enslavement. This is the value of Free-Will above all…

Roleplay Notes:

·    Try and sell the pitch the Speaker of the Children of the Stars is giving.

·    Refute anything the PCs say negative about them.

·    Ask the adventurers where they have been for the last 3 years!

·    Anything you can do to sell the idea that the Children of the Stars are legit and helpful to Elysian morale.

·    NOTHING SEEMS OUT OF PLACE TO YOU!!!! The koolaide is strong with them and tastes amazing lol

·    Talk about how weak the current Duke Thermo is! Duke Ryldinmar would never have let this happen on his watch!
