-Cyrptinth was the home of Duke Ryldinmar Cyrptinth after he retired

- Kysol  Ezeal was obliterated and exiled, upon his death he transformed to a Master Werewolf and fled to his leiges home and bit a large amount of people to make an Army of Lycans if anyone hunted him and found him
- The Feral Lycans follow “Duke” Ezeal loyally in the wilds around Cryptinith. There have been a large increase of The Feral  as of recently. There have been reports over the years that Kissel Ezeal still lives and is the leader of The Feral but no-one can confirm this rumor
  -EVERYONE IN CYRPTINTH ARE LYCANS
  -There is a Magic on the town that protects it from transforming within the city walls. If you are outside of the city walls when the Sunsets, your Curse of Transformation will trigger and the Feral will come for you to recruit you. If you are inside the City Gates before sundown, despite the moonphase, you will be able to resist the call to Transform by the Moon
  -Kissel Ezeal is the Alpha (leader) of the Feral, no one has seen him in years now but they fear he is still out there. His Beta of the Feral, Ulrick Firepaw has been very active as of these past 2 months since the reports from Moutesque have stopped coming out. If they Feral catch any Lycans transformed after Dark, they have a ritual they perform to sway them to their side and embrace their inner Lycan.
  -The Lord Reeve, Kymiru Cryptinith, runs the town in Duke Rildemar’s stead. Even though retired, the former Duke is still a very busy man and leaves his affairs to his younger cousin who re-emerged after he accepted his Dark Elf BirthRight.
  -If the Feral bite you, they can inflict a Curse or Transformation on you based on their Lycan type.
  -The trigger for the CoT will be: Outside the City Gates of Cryptinth after dark. There will be a siren played and if you are caught outside the City Gates you will be forced into a Berserker State as your CoT comes tearing out. You will be handed a Stat card to add to yours, YOU WILL FIGHT EVERYTHING YOU SEE!
  -Calm will bring them out of the Berserker state but they are Immune to Awaken

### Laws of Cryptinith

All Lycans must be within the City Gates at sundown to be protected from Transformation. If you are found outside the City Gates and Transformed after dark, you will be assumed to be a “Feral” and will be slain if you do not comply. Feral cannot speak to non-Transformed Lycans. 
No Silver Weaponry is to be displayed openly, if found openly displaying or brandishing silver weaponry, You will be fined and the weapon will be confiscated until you leave the City Gates
No Silver Coin is to be spent on merchant wears within the City Walls. Offering to buy things with Silver Coin in the City Walls is illegal and will result in Silver being melted down. Please conduct Silver Coin exchanges outside the City Proper
Slaying of a Lycan within the City Walls is strictly forbidden unless they are “Feral” or transform and attack you first. Feral who enter the City Walls know they will be impaled on Silver Spears as an example. 
Aiding any agents of the Undead will result in public execution. NO EXCEPTIONS
Do not invoke a Silver Aura spell on your blade within the City Walls unless attacked by “Feral” This will be considered a serious crime and treated as assault or attempted murder under the laws of Elysia otherwise.
If a Lycan is transformed within the City Walls, you are to ask them “Who is the Duke? Do you respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith?” If the answer is “Duke Ezeal” or they refuse to respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith, they are to be struck down and put in chains of Silver till they return to their senses. If they cannot respond to you, they are to be considered Feral and be Executed for their blatant acceptance of a wanted Outlaw of Elysia. If the Lycan is fully coherent and under control of themselves, they will be asked to drop their Transformation if possible and to answer with the current Dukes name aswell as if they respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith. If all are in compliance then no crimes or punishment will be rendered upon the Lycan.

These Laws are to PROTECT the citizens of Cryptinith, they may seem extreme in some regards but they have ensured us 20 years of peace and 20 more if they are followed. The “Feral” are to be slain and treated just like Undead as they have been known to conspire with them.
