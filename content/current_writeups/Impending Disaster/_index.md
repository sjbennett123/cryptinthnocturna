  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards
   
  “We have received a report from letters on a scouting party we vanquished recently that the Bloody Fist intend to attack the Guild Hall or the buildings around it mid day on the second day of the market gathering. A time was not specifically stated but we should be vigilant anytime after lunch time that they will come for our newly reopened Guild Halls to try and cut us off from prosperity and resources to fight them. I would venture to say they are upset we reclaimed their prisoners during the Winter after the first gathering in Stonewood this past late Autumn. Eat hearty but keep your eyes sharp.”
