title: A Grainy Situation
layout: module
plotline: The Rat Pack
author: Brittney Perry
description: The city's food stores are overran by giant field rats. These rats will eat everything and spread disease. The city is asking the local adventurers to help clear the rats.
synopsis: A group of adventurers enter the grain stores of the city to clear out the Giant Field Rat infestation. The grain stores are dangerous, and sink holes are easy to step into. If a PC steps into a sink hole, they remain stuck [Pin] until pulled from the grain. Pulling from the grain is an uninterrupted three count. You cannot free yourself if you step in the grain. The PC has a 60 second count to be rescued, before the grain crushes them and they enter their death count. The Rats are immune to the sink holes and may walk freely.
outcomes: 
  - The PCs clear out the rats and collect the bounty
  - The PCs do not clear out the rats, and they don't get a bounty
Hook: Goodwin Copperriver recruits a group at the end of STONEWOOD CITY PEST AND SANITATION
Number_of_Cast_members: 5 or more.
scenes: 
  - 
    oog: Module Building. Strewn around the room are yellow plastic table cloths, which are grain sink holes. If a PC steps or falls into a grain pit, they are Pinned until they are rescued on a three count [One I pull you free, Two I pull you free... etc]. If they are not rescued in 60 seconds, they sink and enter their death count. They can still be rescued on a three count, but now they need a life spell.
