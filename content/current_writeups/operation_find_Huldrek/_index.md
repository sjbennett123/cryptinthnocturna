description: After being tasked with finding Huldrek, the adventurers track him using Craftsman Other- Tracking [Level 1 or above] back to the cache of the Tarrasch, where he is standing guard. At 12pm Saturday he will abandon his post if not found.

synopsis: > 
  Granny Whuthona was very helpful in describing her grandson and now the PCs are able to track Huldrek to his post, the cache of the Tarrasch. Huldrek is on guard duty at the cache and has been for the past few days. He ran out of drink early on in his duty, and is in desperate need of a bottle. The closer to noon it gets, the more anxious he gets. 
  Unfortunately for Huldrek, when he is found, he is found sober, outnumbered  and out-weaponed. He will try to bluff his way into getting them to leave and if that doesn't work, he will run rather than fight. The treasure is left unguarded and free for the taking if the PCs wish.
  The closer to 12pm it gets, the more agitated and short tempered he becomes, and Huldrek will abandon his watch at 12 pm Saturday, making his way into the tavern in search of a bottle and maybe a card game. 

outcomes: 
  - The PCs are able to track Huldrek to his post in the woods and convince, threaten, or capture him into leaving his duty.
  - The PCs don't track Huldrek and he shows up in the tavern after 12pm Saturday [module failure, spawns YOU FOUND HULDREK]

  Scene Description- The chest is somewhere in the woods, away from the path, where you would never just stumble on it. Huldrek is standing guard, mumbling to himself and unaware of the PCs approach until they are close or make themselves known.

  Huldrek has been on constant guard duty for several days. He is dirty and disheveled, and is twitchy, mumbling to himself.
 
  The closer to 12pm it is dictates how agitated Huldrek is and how easy he is to convince to leave his post
    - Dawn to 9 am- Huldrek has just woken up from his sleep and is grumpy and stubborn. Huldrek will not leave his post easily, and will try to bluff [eg. There are dozens of people surrounding you!, I am a deadly fighter!] Flee point is out of site of PCs High Stubbornness/Low tolerance to threat. Will fight if attacked until 50 body and then run..
    - 9am to 11am- Huldrek is starting to really need a drink and wants to leave. It doesn't take much convincing or threatening to get him to leave. Flee point is out of site of PCs Medium Stubbornness/ Medium tolerance to threat. Will run if being physically attacked or threatened.
    - 11am to 12p- Huldrek will bluff threat and then run when approached by PCs. If he gets out of sight of the PCs, he will have escaped. Low Stubbornness/No Tolerance to threat. Will bluff threaten and then run when approached.
