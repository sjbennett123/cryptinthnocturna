Layout: module

author: Brittney Perry

schedule: saturday
plotline: Family Recipes
requirements: Completion of the module "Help Wanted" and before Noon on Satruday

description: After being tasked with finding Huldrek by Granny Silverlode in the module "Help Wanted", the adventurers can track him using back to the cache of the Tarrasch, where he is standing guard. At Noon Saturday he abandons his post and comes to the Tavern to get hammered.

synopsis: >
  Granny Silverlod was helpful in describing her grandson and now the PCs are able to track Huldrek to his post, the cache of the Tarrasch. Huldrek is on guard duty at the cache and has been for the past few days. He has ran out of drink early on in his duty, and is in desperate need of the bottle. The closer to noon it gets, the more anxious he gets. Huldrek will abandon his watch at 12 pm Saturday, making his way into the tavern in search of a bottle and maybe a card game.  Huldrek is not allowed in the Tavern. It is the one place that he is not allowed!

  
  
  Unfortunately for Huldrek, when he is found, he is found sober, outnumbered  and out-weaponed. He will try to bluff his way into getting them to leave and if that doesn't work, he will run rather than fight. The treasure is left unguarded and free for the taking if the PCs wish.
  
  

outcomes: 
  - The PCs convince Huldrek to give over the Tarrasch treasure chest. 
  - The PCs don't track Huldrek and he shows up in the tavern after Noon Saturday. Run "You Found Huldrek"

  Scene Description- The chest is somewhere in the woods, away from the path, where you would never just stumble on it. Huldrek is standing guard, mumbling to himself and unaware of the PCs approach until they are close or make themselves known.
  Huldrek has been on constant guard duty for several days. He is dirty and disheveled, and is twitchy, mumbling to himself.
  
  The closer to 12pm it is dictates how agitated Huldrek is and how easy he is to convince to leave his post
  - Dawn to 9 am- Huldrek has just woken up from his sleep and is grumpy and stubborn. Huldrek will not leave his post easily, and will try to bluff [eg. There are dozens of people surrounding you!, I am a deadly fighter!] Flee point is out of site of PCs High Stubbornness/Low tolerance to threat. Will fight if attacked until 50 body and then run..
  
  - 9am to 11am- Huldrek is starting to really need a drink and wants to leave. It doesn't take much convincing or threatening to get him to leave. Flee point is out of site of PCs Medium Stubbornness/ Medium tolerance to threat. Will run if being physically attacked or threatened.
  
  - 11am to 12p- Huldrek will bluff threat and then run when approached by PCs. If he gets out of sight of the PCs, he will have escaped. Low Stubbornness/No Tolerance to threat. Will bluff threaten and then run when approached.
  The chest prop and all contents can be taken and kept until end of event or completion of module THE EXCHANGE

Operation Find Huldrek
- Would the PCs know to use Carftsman other tracking? Are there any PCs playing that have that skill - might want to check with Ken (logistics)?
- What are Dwarven "stones" and random Dwarven treasure?
- This implies that Huldrek will run if confronted. Is is assumed the PCs will chase him and take him into their custody to return to Granny? What if they don;t?
- This is a lot of treasure to give out for no risk and what appears to be little effort. Is there some danger here that wasn't mentioned? There is an assumption that it will still be intact later to give back to rescue Granny. Is that realistic? Since the consequences are to an NPC, will that be enough? May want to consider taking a player hostage with her.
- How much time will the players have to invest to track this? Will a dedicated NPC have to be with them the whole time to support the tracking? Not familiar with how this skill is worked in game. 
- Consider giving the players a way to use their craftsman other skill that would allow the treasure to be hidden better. For example, they could start at Grannies and look for a particular "footprint" left by Huldrick's shoes. This could be represented by a colored daub on the ground or something of that sort and they might have to wander around looking for the "next" print to figure out where he went. He could have gone a LOT of places. Anyway, just some thoughts. Perhaps they have to walk over a ravine by staying on a 2x4 without having their feet touch the ground on either side, or push through underbrush that has poison on it to make it more interesting with some physical challenges. Just some thoughts.
