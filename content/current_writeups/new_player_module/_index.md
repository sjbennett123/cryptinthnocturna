There will be no Arcane Renew after this mod, whatever the PCs use on the mod will be lost until the next time the skills will reset by standard reset rules.

This mod will be hooked by the Mod Marshall, he will let the PCs know of a situation where some of the Ferals will have attacked a group of scouts and it is the PCs job to rescue those that they can.  These Ferals are not the normal card of the Ferals for the event, things that happen to free the scouts of these status effects will not work for the event itself, at the Event Director's discretion, he could write the cards that these can all be solved the same way, but that is up to the Event Director hismself.  Number of Encounters 3-4 scale by reset.  The first wave will be Were Rats, they have the carrier Disease and Weakness, 1 may have the carrier Paralysis.

Dmg calls 5 Normal Disease, 5 Normal weakness, and 1 will have 5 Normal Paralysis.

Dmg calls that affect NPCs:  All, Double Dmg from Silver, must be Killing Blowed by Silver or will revive and renew at the Will to Live Count, so 1 minute after dropping, they will revive, 1 minute later they will renew.  If killing Blowed after reviving by Silver they will die.  After the first wave, the PCs will encounter some scouts in various status effects, they will have to use Healing Arts, to discover what and they will have to choose to resolve or choose to let the status effect expire.

The second wave will be Feral Werewolves,  they will swing just 5 Normal no carrier, but they will be KBA,  the killing blow call is I infect you one, I infect you two I infect you 3, if the killing blow is interuppted the infection will not take place.  If a PC is killed by a Feral, he will be infected with Curse of Transformation Werewolf, this CoT can be resolved by either dealing a Killing Blow, and Lifing the subject, or can be removed after Identification in a circle, with the remove Curse Spell.  A life Spell will automatically remove the CoT

CoT sheets need to be printed, and they are as follows, if you are infected with the CoT, you will take double dmg from Silver, take normal dmg from everything else except normal weapons, you must have the CoT removed, or you will be able to be voice controlled by any other Feral for the remainder of the event.

Feral Werewolves and those that are affected by the CoT, you are immune to Normal Weapons, you take double dmg from Silver must be killed by Silver, if you have the CoT, you can be voice controlled by other Ferals.

The New Players must resolve the situations to their utmost ability, if they do not then the above mentioned things will take place.
