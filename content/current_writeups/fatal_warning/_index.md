**Brief**: The Bloody Fist have failed to burn the town of Stonewood down by conventional means so now they play with a bigger Ace in their sleeve. People are wandering around with Pamphlets essentially reading “Surrender or Burn”.

**Requirements**: 

- Both Fears by Torchlight modules have ran

**Synopsis**: This is the final and fatal warning of the Bloody Fist. All named Townsfolk enter the town with these pamphlets outlining an evacuation protocol for the citizens of Stonewood. The pamphlets seem to be a humane request for innocents to leave before this escalates but the wording is very grim for what is to come…
**Outcomes**:

1. The players are given the pamphlets by other NPCs or roaming Scouts with no weapons. They aren’t here to fight; they have come to deliver a message.

**Rumors**: The patrols have been increasing at night as of late. Something marches in under the cover of darkness. For what purpose, only a sinister feel behind it. Why use torches at night when the moon provides a perfect veil for criminal activities. I have noticed more trees missing branches around the town lately, freshly cut too. I thought only the Dwarves of Stonewood understood the way to harvest them. But this seems crude and hasty
~Black Leaf, The Anvil Remembers Stonewood

**Hook**: All Named townsfolk come to the Tavern with these pamphlets in hand, Scouts follow them to distribute them 

**Number of Cast Members**: 7

**Props**: Bloody Fist Pamphlets Bloody Fist Costuming & Makeup (Red Scales on left side of face and 4 finger mark warpaint on right side of face), Named townsfolk costuming

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Whole Camp (IG) The Town of Stonewood

**Flee Point**: This module is site/town wide

**Non-Standard Effects**: None

**Rules Clarifications**: None

**Running Notes**: This module is a non-combative encounter. 4-5 named NPC enter the Tavern reading the Bloody Fist pamphlets to themselves in confusion and fear. 3 Bloody Fist Scouts enter unarmed with hands up, these Scouts are just delivering more pamphlets and then leaving. A large scene will erupt in the Tavern as the townsfolk are enraged for different reasons. This roleplay encounter will setup the Final Module for later, the Ritual of Fire. Each NPC will give different talking points and try to bring the players to different conclusions. At the climax of this scene Durmac will make a triumphant statement and storm out of the Tavern to go speak with the Bloody Fist only to find an assassin waiting for him to stab a pamphlet to his chest and kill him for his defiance
