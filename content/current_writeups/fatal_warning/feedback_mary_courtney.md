 - Is the "Surrender or Burn" meant literally. Thought the bomb was
only psychic. Is this meant to be intentionally misleading?

    This is the orcs cautioning the players about the coming summoning of the Baleful Fire Drakes. 

 - It says noncombatant but lists treasure. What is the means the players must use to earn the tressure? Is this only there in case the PCs attack the Orcs and get their treasure?
 
    Yes that is the case.
