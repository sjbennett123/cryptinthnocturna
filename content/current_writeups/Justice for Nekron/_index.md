synopsis: > 
  Early in the morning, just after sunrise, a Speaker of Nekron and a Blade of Nekron were killed outside of the City Walls on a walk. A traumatized Follower of the “Children of the Stars” saw the Lycan who slayed them flew into the City Gates. With help of Hakkens Blade, they have gathered up the 5 suspects they believe might be. It is upto the players now to play Jury and Executioner now. The Speaker Issac Tempest will be the one rounding up the PCs and explaining the situation. The traumatized Follower will be present but will side with whatever the players choose is the Guilty party as they only saw a Lycan and not the human form. 

  A Speaker of Nekron and his Blade of Nekron were brutally murdered in the early morning hours and the Lycan fled into the City Gates. The 5 suspects all seem to be ruffians and potentially guilty but one is definitely the killer. It is up to the players to find and execute the right man. Speaker Issac doesn’t care who it is, he just wants “Justice” for his Followers being killed. The 5 suspects will give a story and then it’s up to the players to decide who they believe and pass judgment. 

 
outcomes:
  - The PCs find the killer and put him to death
  - The PCs sentence an innocent person to death and the killer goes free
  - Regardless of of an innocent was killed, Speaker Issac will pay the PCs for their “services” and “aid” in bringing a murderer to Justice.
