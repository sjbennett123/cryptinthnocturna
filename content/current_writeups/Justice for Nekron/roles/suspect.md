**Role Play Notes**:

**choose a vice**: drinking, fighting gambling, lying, brothels, stealing

·    Make your story have a flaw or two in it so it is believable enough, but something seems off

·    You ALL have a crippling Vice (drinking, fighting gambling, lying, brothels, stealing, etc) so weave that into the story to make yourself seem questionable.



·    If they look like they are picking you as the “guilty” party, beg and plead for your life OR just tell them to get it over with and accept your fate



·    The “Real Murderer” is Suspect #5! Your motive was that you didn’t like the way the Speaker “smelled” just something was “off” about him and it drove you into a bloodlust, the next thing you knew your Transform took over and you murdered them. You remember fleeing into the City Gates and hiding till someone found you passed out in an alleyway.

·    Suspect #5 will elect for Trial by Combat for his death if they sentence him to Death. He isn’t granted this rite by law but it is upto the PCs if they choose to accept his terms of not. If they accept his terms then he shifts when the fight begins. If they decline his request, then he will get very aggressive and back into a corner and start snarling at the PCS (Use Feral Random Card for Fight)

·    If any of the other Suspects are picked for Execution, they will either beg/plead or just tell them to get it over with and kneel
