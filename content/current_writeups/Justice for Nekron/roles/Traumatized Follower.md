**Role Play Notes**:

·    This REALLY mortified you seeing a Speaker and a Blade mauled by a “wild” Lycan

·    Your family has been helped greatly by the Children of the Stars

·    The Speaker who was slain personally saved your Son from a Feral 3 months ago

·    SOMEONE MUST PAY!!!! You wont be satisfied till the laws of Elysia get a murdered executed for committing such an act

·    If anyone speaks to you directly, you will back away and try to hide behind Speaker Issac
