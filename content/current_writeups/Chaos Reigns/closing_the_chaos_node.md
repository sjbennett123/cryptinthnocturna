title: closing the chaos node
---

During the fight Solomon mutters phrases and advice to help in “closing the Chaos Node” but for the most part he is there for dramatic effect.

Closing the Chaos Node take 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration. Solomon will keep track IG/OOG of the time spent closing the Chaos Node. 

- If they close it within 15 minutes, the Node will close and can be opened to retrieve the Sapphire Amulet. 

- If they take more than 15 minutes to close it, Solomon will pass out and the Magic Item inside the Node will vanish to be found elsewhere.
