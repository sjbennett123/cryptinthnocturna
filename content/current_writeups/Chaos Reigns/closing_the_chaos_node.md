title: closing the chaos node
---

During the fight Solomon mutters phrases and advice to help in “closing the Chaos Node” but for the most part he is there for dramatic effect.

When they begin the “closing” this will take 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration. 

- If they take more than 15 minutes to close it, Solomon will pass out and the Magic Item inside the Node will vanish to be found elsewhere.

- If they close it within the 15 minutes, the Node will close and can be opened to retrieve the Sapphire Amulet. 

The easiest way to do this is to Imprison someone around the box with a cloak as a shield. Solomon will keep track IG/OOG of the time spent closing the Chaos Node.
