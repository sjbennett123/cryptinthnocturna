Merrick.

My friend.

I have made a mistake. 

I have been influenced and have activated a chaos node. The horrors that come from this are not under my control.  Please come and assist me I cannot handle this on my own. The madness has crept into me. The Green Eyed one promised me that this would help Montesque but it seems that that was a lie and now the visions come more horrific than the last. 

I am outside of the museum that we we reclaimed earlier today. Please Help. I cannot prevail. 

Solomon Zanth
