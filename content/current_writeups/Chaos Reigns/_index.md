  - Terror Train 5 has been ran
  - This module is the final thing before Reset on Saturday Evening. 

description: Chaos has seeped into the mind of Solomon Zeneth. His sanity was already unstable but now in his madness he has called forth Chaos creatures from a Chaos Node in Moutesque that must be sealed.
synopsis: Solomon Zeneth is attacked by the power of a Chaos Node he discovered while in Moutesque. Before he looses the ability to focus his energy he sends a Whispering Wind to the Merrick, wherever he is, to come to Moutesque ASAP and seek him out that a Chaos Node has ripped open in the street outside of Museum they reclaimed earlier.
  Merrick receives the call to this module via Whispering Wind. When they arrive in Moutesque  Solomon Zeneth is writhing in insanity and agony on his knees in the street in front of the Museum of Moutesque surrounded by 6 Chaos Knights. During the fight he mutters phrases and advice to help them in “closing the Chaos Node” but for the most part he is there for dramatic effect. When they begin the “closing” this will take 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration.  Solomon will keep track IG/OOG of the time spent closing the Chaos Node. If they take more than 15 minutes to close it, Solomon will pass out and the Magic Item inside the Node will vanish to be found elsewhere. If they close it within the 15 minutes, the Node will close and can be opened to retrieve the Sapphire Amulet. 

  The Chaos Node will call to Merrick and when he touches it after the module is over, Merrick will be rifted to the Chaos Plane where he will meet his Mothers Spirit Animal, the Chaos Stag. After a conversation, Merrick will receive his lvl 7 transform and start him on the path. He will return to the group, it is up to Merrick if he comes back transformed or not. Dramatically it would look awesome if he did but that is the PCs call. 

outcomes: 
  - The PCs close the Chaos Node and Solomon Zeneth collapses into a restful recovery for 10 minutes
  - The PCs fail to close the Chaos Node and Solomon Zeneth writhes in agony until his body passes out for the next few hours delaying the progress able to be made
