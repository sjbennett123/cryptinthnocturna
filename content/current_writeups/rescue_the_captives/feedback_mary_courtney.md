 - What happens if the Orcs get beaten down and don't take captives
   **these are captives that are PC's that volunteered to be captured ahead of time.** 
- If captives are taken, where do they go and how do the PCs know how
  to rescue them?
    **these are players that volunteered to be captured** 
- What are you planning to do with the captives? Do you plan to kill
  them unless they are smart enough to escape?
    **the players rescue them.** 
- Why is a Dark Bargain with the Black Shadow linked to this mod?
    **it is additional information that the PC captives get.**
