I want them both to have met Vel’Kez in the camps so they know his face when he steps on the field where the others don’t. Like he met them when they were so out of it and being beaten by his men

I think it was Call of Duty or a Tom Clancy game where you are tied to a chair getting the fuck best out of you and the villain walks up and puts his cigar out on your chest and slaps you in the face while his dudes have you bloody and beaten

That kind of energy

Bobby went the guerilla warefare crawling around in the mud tactic till he got caught

Clinton went in raging with nothing on him but claws until he was captured to gather what he could while being tortured

Vel’Kaz should take a knife and cut both of them and lick the blood off and say something cryptic like “I’ll remember the taste of your blood for later….”
