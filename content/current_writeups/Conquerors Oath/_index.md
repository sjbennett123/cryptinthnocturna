description: “Aging warrior, looking back at the life that you've led. Can you say with confidence that you would do it again? For one day you'll be gone, and all that lives on, Is the honour of thy name and the deeds that you've done” is the Conqueror’s Oath Loken “Bloodhammer” Oakrider will live and die by. Preserving this ideal, Loken seeks to end the reign of a coward puppet Mayor and liberate the people of Stonewood.

Synopsis: Mayor Durag will enter the tavern for a drink of his Bristle Brock, but unknowing to him Loken Oakrider will have followed him here to publicly challenge him to a contest of Dwarven Might in the Old Ways of Stonewood for his title of Mayor, any Stonewood Dwarf that is worth is salt would not dare back down from such a serious challenge… But Mayor Durag will play his age and injuries card and elect for the Rite of a Champion. Not surprised by this cowardly choice, Loken will grant him 30 minutes to name, find his champion, and return to the Tavern for the Duel to take place so that Honor may be settled…
outcomes: 
  - Loken will challenge Mayor Durag and defeat his champion, the execution of Mayor Durag will be left to Loken but he will defer the sentencing to Baron Hadukkel…. If Mayor Durag is killed he transforms into an Aplha Pathergast
  - Loken is defeated and Durag chooses to “spare” Loken as a sign of good faith since he was trying to do the right thing but obviously the spirits weren’t on his side…

  Rumor Circulating the Town

  “A Dwarf with the likeness of one of Stonewoods original heroes has been seen around town. Though his clothing and weapons may have changed, there is no mistaking his Red beard and his helmet. His voice inspires courage and confidence in those around him. Though he was thought to be long dead or moved onto Golden Halls, Loken Oakrider was his name. If this really is Loken, then the Bloody Fist are in for a world of pain!”
Hook: Mayor Durag enters the Tavern for a Drink and Loken pursues him to challenge
transformations: Lil Bristle transforms into an alpha Panthergast on death.

running_notes: |
  This module is the execution of Mayor Durag in a honor combat form. The terms of the combat will be No Magic, Just Strength of Arms. Loken will challenge him and defeat his champion unless something unseen happens. Mayor Durag will bring a Bloody Fist Honor Guard for his champion, securing his downfall either way. Upon Durag’s death he will Transform to a Alpha Pantherghast  Dwarf, a hold will be called and the NPCs will swap out for a “Transformed” APG version of Mayor Durag. 

  Friday night after refusing the terms of Welcome to OrcTown, as a final insult to Durag and his submissiveness to the Fist, Vel’Kaz ordered this  to be done cause he knew Mayor Durag was on borrowed time then, a group of Bloody Fist waited for him at his house and forced a Curse of Transformation Alpha Pantherghast on Mayor Durags spirit and then Forget-It-Well his memory so he doesn’t remember the act but he knows what is on his spirit. When he woke up he had a note on his chest “Tell no one about your spirit changing or your whole town DIES!!!! And the letter was signed ~V
