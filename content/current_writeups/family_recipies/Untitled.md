## Character Sheet- Charles “Charlie” Glynnhall



*Charlie is a simple man, who loves his Granny. Unfortunately, Charlie has fallen in with the wrong crowd. The Felhands came a'calling one day, and ol' Charlie answered. Now, he's a Felhand Meatshield, who get's 2% of all treasure stolen or goods fenced as payment for his services.*



*Charlie is a self centered and selfish dwarf who thinks of nothing but himself. He is crass and sarcastic, entitled, lazy, and a coward. Charlie only thinks of Charlie and how things effect him.*





***Traits:***

- *Absentminded- Charlie would lose his head if it wasn't attached*
- *Abrasive-No one really likes Charlie. He is gruff, angry, short tempered, and just all around an disagreeable man to be around. The complete opposite of Granny.*
- *Aggressive-You looking at me funny? You wanna fight? Let's go outside!*
- *Callous- He can't be bothered to care about pretty much anything or anyone, except his Granny, and that doesn't include not robbing her.*
- *Careless- He gave no effort in hiding his trail out to the treasure box, or make himself unnoticeable in the tavern he chose to get drunk in.*
- *Charmless- Charlie couldn't charm a wort on a toad, much less charm a person.*
- *Conceited- He thinks he is the perfect specimen, despite having never won a fight.*
- *Coweredly- If a real fight breaks out, Charlie will always run. Being pressed even a little bit has him spouting family secrets.*
- *Criminal- Charlie sees nothing wrong in taking what isn't his. After all, it was owed to him*
- *Dependent- If it hadn't been for his grandmother, Charlie would have lived and died in a gutter. He lacks the willpower to take care of himself.*
- *Desperate- Charlie has a severe gambling and drinking problem he has to finance. He has no job.*
- *Dishonest- Charlie will shake your hand with one hand and with the other, stab you in the back. You couldn't trust it if this man told you the sky was blue and the grass was green.*  
- *Dramatic- Oh woe is me! Everything is awful and it's the worse it could be!*
- *Entitled- The world owes Charlie everything.*   
- *Greedy- Charlie wants all the money, he just doesn't want to work for it.*
- *Gullible- The Felhand was able to convince Charlie to be their stooge, and to steal Granny's book.*
- *Lazy- The only thing Charlie has been on time for is his dinner. And don't give him anything to do with a deadline*
- *Narcissistic- Charlie is incredibly self centered, and only thinks of others when it benefits him*
- *Opportunistic- When a chance to make a quick buck comes along, Charlie is right there to swindle people out of their gold. No job is off limits, except for killing.*
- *Proud- Charlie has a strong dwarven pride, even though he shouldn't be proud of the things he's done.*
- *Resentful- Charlie, even though he loves his Granny, he resents her not letting him go out and adventure. He resents everyone else's good fortune. And he resents the fact that he isn't in charge of the Felhand.*
- *Sarcastic- Charlie has a sarcastic tone of voice, and uses sarcasm frequently*
- *Selfish- Charlie is incredibly selfish, even for a dwarf.*  
- *Stressed- After becoming a Fellhand, Charlie started seeing people following him. After the stress of the occupation and the paranoia of being followed, Charlie started biting his nails as a stress response.*
- *Stubborn- A dwarf with dwarven stubbornness*
- *Thievish- Charlie will, and has, robbed is own Grandmother blind. You think your purse is safe?*
- *Tough- Say what you want about Charlie, but he can sure take a beating.*
- *Unprincipled- Charlie doesn't have a code he lives by, he usually just does what ever feels good in the moment.*
