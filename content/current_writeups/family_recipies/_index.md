# Family Recipes Overview



​	**Grandma Linda Glynhall,** a long retired adventurer, is quite glad the siege of Stonewood is over. Having spent the summer under brutal occupation and the long winter just trying to survive, this spring brings with it a renewed vigor that can only come from a newfound freedom. “Granny”, hearing that the adventurer's would be returning to Stonewood, has decided to bake up a delicious batch of cookies as a thank you. Only one problem, her recipe book has gone missing!

​	**Charles “Charlie” Glynnhall,** grandson of Granny Glynhall, has always had his problems. He's not to bright, and is always getting into trouble. After losing his parents at a young age, he was sent to be raised by his grandmother. Granny did her best, but Charlie wanted more than she was able to give. He craved adventure, but his grandmother, knowing where that type of life leads, forbade him from leaving the city. When the Orcs took over Stonewood, Charlie saw the perfect opportunity He tried to rebel and take down the orcs, but was quickly beaten to within an inch of his life. Not by the Orcs; they wouldn't have left him alive. No, he was beaten by his neighbors, because anyone who defied the Orcs would bring their wrath down upon everyone. Chastised and wounded, Charlie spent the remainder of the occupation holed up in Granny's house. When the city was liberated, Charlie took to his new found freedom by drinking and gambling in excess. When his money ran out, he started borrowing. Soon, no one would lend him money or drink and Charlie found himself in trouble again, this time seemingly at the end of his rope.

​	The **Felhand** follow the adventurers like rats, feeding off of the scraps left behind when they leave a place. The loot is less, but the chances of being caught are slim in the chaos that happens after a Market Day. And if someone turns up dead, well, maybe they were killed during the Market? Who's to say? 

​	It was during this time, in the worse than usual chaos that October's Market had brought, that the Felhand found Charlie, arguing with the local barkeep to “just give me one! I'm good for it, I swear!”. After having paid for their new friend's drink, they sat and talked with the long time resident. The Felhand decided that maybe having a local around Stonewood wasn't a bad idea with all the unrest and a Market coming up. Plus, his eyes, ears, and loyalty came cheap. As long as Charlie was supplied with cheap liquor and a few gold to gamble, he was a happy man. 

​	Charlie, in debt but with new friends, is now becoming braver and braver. When an argument with his grandmother doesn't go this way, he decides to take matters into his own hands and plots revenge for the slight. Knowing how valuable his grandmother'sr recipe book is, he takes the book from its place hides it in the cache of the Felhand. The symbol of the thieving group is on the lid of the treasure box.

​	Granny has no idea where her recipe book went. Last time she saw it, she had it on the shelf. She didn't remember moving it, or even using it recently, but it was missing. She tried to get her grandson to help, but he refused and left for the bar. He hasn't come home in a few days, and now she is getting worried. To old to go looking herself, Granny has put a couple of ads in the local paper:

​	

HELP WANTED- REWARD 10 SILVER

Looking for someone to find my grandson, Charles Glynhall. 

Charlie has been missing for 3 days, and I am too old to seek him out myself.

If you wish to help, I can be found at my home at most times [directions]

-Granny Linda Glynhall











HELP WANTED- REWARD 20 SILVER

For the finding of a dearly loved recipe book. The book has been in my family for ages and is filled with Glynhall family recipies! Somehow it has gone missing, and I am

in desperate need of help to find it. 

If you wish to help, I can be found at my home at most times [directions]

-Granny Linda Glynhall



​	If the PCs decide to go to Granny's house **[module HELP WANTED]**, Granny will greet them in a friendly manner. Granny has never met a stranger, and loves everyone. Conversation can include anything written in her history, information about her grandson that she would know, the orc occupation and how she did through it, hobbies, her baking, her book, her home, etc. When all information has been relayed and/or the PCs wish to leave, Granny will see them to the door and wish them a lovely day!

​	If the PCs track Charlie using CRAFTSMAN SKILL: OTHER [Level 1] , they will track him back to the cache of the Felhand, where he is standing guard. **[module YOU FOUND CHARLIE]** If the PCs don't seek to find him, or if the module HELP WANTED isn't completed, [within 2 hours of visiting Granny or after 12pm Saturday] Charlie will turn up in the tavern with his bottle being an asshole. **[module OPERATION FIND CHARLIE]** He is unarmed. He taunts the PCs to the point of confrontation, but before it comes to blows or duels, Charlie makes a deal. He'll give the group a map to a treasure cache if they pay his tab and let him go. He hands a crude map to the group, and he runs off before anyone can change their mind. If it does come to a fight, and he is beaten down, the map is the only thing found on his person.

​	Once the cache has been cleared and the book returned **[module CASH IN THE CACHE]**, the Felhand find out that they lost their loot and it is obvious who did it, as Charlie was on guard duty for the duration of the market. 

​	If Charlie is taken and given back to his Grandmother for the reward, Granny will pay the reward and ask that the PCs leave so she can talk to Charlie. **[module RETURNING CHARLIE]**

​	Charlie, having left his post, is beaten by the thieving group, and he tells the Felhand what he did and who took their treasure. They release Charlie to go and take a message to those that stole from them. 

​	Charlie, beaten and bloody, finds the group that he lead to the treasure or took his map, and begs for help. **[module EMERGENCY! HELP WANTED]** He explains what happened, that the thieves want their money back or they will kill Charlie. As the group is talking, a messenger interrupts and gives Charlie a note. In it is a finger tied with a lock of gray hair and a note that says:



Charlie, how stupid can you be? 

We want 75 Gold and the return of our treasure for the

safe return of your Grandmother.

Bring the gold to **[place in camp away from shack]*, alone.

We know you went to that adventuring scum in the city.

They need to stay out of this if you know what's good for you.



​	At the spot, the Felhand have the area surrounded and can see the spot clearly. **[module THE EXCHANGE]**

​	If the PCs allow Charlie to take the gold to the spot, alone, Granny will be seen wandering into town unharmed, minus the finger, after the mod is completed. 

​	If the PCs allow Charlie to take the gold but follow, set up an ambush, set up a trap, try to negotiate, make a trade, just refuse to pay, or in anyway make themselves known to the waiting Felhand, they will attack. They will fight until there are three left, and the rest will run. If any are able to run, and any make it back to Granny they will kill her. If none make it back, and Granny is tracked, she is returned unharmed. Charlie will suggest someone track her if no Felhand make it back and the Felhand were not questioned before killing them. If a Felhand member is questioned, they will give up the location of Granny under threat of death or torture. Once, and if, Granny is found, she returns to her home with Charlie.

## Character Sheet- Charles “Charlie” Glynnhall



*Charlie is a simple man, who loves his Granny. Unfortunately, Charlie has fallen in with the wrong crowd. The Felhands came a'calling one day, and ol' Charlie answered. Now, he's a Felhand Meatshield, who get's 2% of all treasure stolen or goods fenced as payment for his services.*



*Charlie is a self centered and selfish dwarf who thinks of nothing but himself. He is crass and sarcastic, entitled, lazy, and a coward. Charlie only thinks of Charlie and how things effect him.*





***Traits:***

- *Absentminded- Charlie would lose his head if it wasn't attached*
- *Abrasive-No one really likes Charlie. He is gruff, angry, short tempered, and just all around an disagreeable man to be around. The complete opposite of Granny.*
- *Aggressive-You looking at me funny? You wanna fight? Let's go outside!*
- *Callous- He can't be bothered to care about pretty much anything or anyone, except his Granny, and that doesn't include not robbing her.*
- *Careless- He gave no effort in hiding his trail out to the treasure box, or make himself unnoticeable in the tavern he chose to get drunk in.*
- *Charmless- Charlie couldn't charm a wort on a toad, much less charm a person.*
- *Conceited- He thinks he is the perfect specimen, despite having never won a fight.*
- *Coweredly- If a real fight breaks out, Charlie will always run. Being pressed even a little bit has him spouting family secrets.*
- *Criminal- Charlie sees nothing wrong in taking what isn't his. After all, it was owed to him*
- *Dependent- If it hadn't been for his grandmother, Charlie would have lived and died in a gutter. He lacks the willpower to take care of himself.*
- *Desperate- Charlie has a severe gambling and drinking problem he has to finance. He has no job.*
- *Dishonest- Charlie will shake your hand with one hand and with the other, stab you in the back. You couldn't trust it if this man told you the sky was blue and the grass was green.*  
- *Dramatic- Oh woe is me! Everything is awful and it's the worse it could be!*
- *Entitled- The world owes Charlie everything.*   
- *Greedy- Charlie wants all the money, he just doesn't want to work for it.*
- *Gullible- The Felhand was able to convince Charlie to be their stooge, and to steal Granny's book.*
- *Lazy- The only thing Charlie has been on time for is his dinner. And don't give him anything to do with a deadline*
- *Narcissistic- Charlie is incredibly self centered, and only thinks of others when it benefits him*
- *Opportunistic- When a chance to make a quick buck comes along, Charlie is right there to swindle people out of their gold. No job is off limits, except for killing.*
- *Proud- Charlie has a strong dwarven pride, even though he shouldn't be proud of the things he's done.*
- *Resentful- Charlie, even though he loves his Granny, he resents her not letting him go out and adventure. He resents everyone else's good fortune. And he resents the fact that he isn't in charge of the Felhand.*
- *Sarcastic- Charlie has a sarcastic tone of voice, and uses sarcasm frequently*
- *Selfish- Charlie is incredibly selfish, even for a dwarf.*  
- *Stressed- After becoming a Fellhand, Charlie started seeing people following him. After the stress of the occupation and the paranoia of being followed, Charlie started biting his nails as a stress response.*
- *Stubborn- A dwarf with dwarven stubbornness*
- *Thievish- Charlie will, and has, robbed is own Grandmother blind. You think your purse is safe?*
- *Tough- Say what you want about Charlie, but he can sure take a beating.*
- *Unprincipled- Charlie doesn't have a code he lives by, he usually just does what ever feels good in the moment.*
