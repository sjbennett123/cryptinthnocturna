description: A worried woman comes to town, trying to find her husband, Luca Norwish.
synopsis: Rose Norwish, wife to Luca Norwish, hasn't seen her husband since the night before. He was coming into Stonewood to find help in clearing some rats on a farmer's property. He didn't return, and that isn't normal for him not to come home at night. She is hoping that he just decided to stay in town, and is looking for him. If the PCs tell Rose about her husband's death, she will understandably be upset, crying and sobbing. She will ask where the body is, and upon seeing it's state, will cry harder. She will calm down eventually and will ask that they bring it to the mortician to bury. She will thank the PCs and leave. If the PCs do NOT tell Rose where her husband is, she will leave town still looking for him. If Rose sees the body before being told about his death, she will scream and collapse upon the site of his mangled corpse. She will eventually calm and ask for help burying him

  - The PCs tell Rose that her husband is dead, she will sob and cry and want to bury him.
