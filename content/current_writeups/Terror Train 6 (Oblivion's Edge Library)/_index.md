Terror Train 6

 

 

**Written by: Chris Colland**        **Reviewed by:** [Name]




 **Brief**: Moutesque City must be reclaimed by Kyumiri Cryptinith’s decree. The second target is the Oblivion's Edge Library. But first they must defeat a Golem at a board game to gain access




 **Requirements:** The Lord Reeves Charge has been ran

 

**Synopsis**: The Oblivion’s Edge Library is a CRITICAL point to reclaim if stability is to be restored to Moutesque. The network of checks and balances of security in Moutesque is normally very tight and seamless. But Demitri Revendreth found a way to ruin all of these years of careful planning.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs reclaim the Library, defeat the door puzzle and Oblivion’s Edge restores it

(2) The PCs fail to reclaim the Library/Door Puzzle or they come back later a respawn

 

**Rumors:** “This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinth. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinth. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous ￼on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinth as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.”

~Kyumiri Cryptinth, High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth

 **Running Notes**: This module is the One of 7 in a chain to reclaim Moutesque. These are the final two modules of it. The Oblivion’s Edge Wraith is a fallen Mage of the Order, they are the field commander these modules. The Eldritch Golem serves as the Puzzle Master, if they kill him the Module is locked!!! The Armor Golems defend the Library to their dying breath. One Floor 2 they will Reset twice. The Module will be setup outside at night. They will play Checkers at the Mod Shack in the lightning, but once the Golem is defeated and stands aside, the module will open up a “door” to the underground Library. The Library will be outside with 2 massive Rope Lights. There will be 2 levels of the Library and the Rope Light edges will be the “walls” of the Library. This will add a cool ambience to the module with a interesting Layout in a odd pattern. The Followup module to this will be outside with the Ropelights too but will be more in a perfect Square to rep a Graveyard with multiple waves of monsters where the Library is a more enclosed battle with a odd layout.
