 **Brief**: Moutesque City must be reclaimed by Kyumiri Cryptinith’s decree. The second target is the Oblivion's Edge Library. But first they must defeat a Golem at a board game to gain access

**Synopsis**: The Oblivion’s Edge Library is a CRITICAL point to reclaim if stability is to be restored to Moutesque. The network of checks and balances of security in Moutesque is normally very tight and seamless. But Demitri Revendreth found a way to ruin all of these years of careful planning.


 **Hook**: The Lord Reeve gives his Charge and tasks the Adventurers with leading an expeditionary force to reclaim Moutesque under the Oblivion’s Edge advice

**Number of Cast Members**: 7

**Roles**: Oblivion’s Edge Wraith, Armor Golem x5, Eldritch Golem x1

**Props**: Black Robes /w Blue Tabard, White Tabards, Undead Makeup

**Tags and Treasure**: Coins, Components, Production

**Scene 1**: (OOG) Mod Shack (IG) Moutesque Order Library

**Flee Point**: Mod Shack Door



 **Running Notes**: This module is the One of 7 in a chain to reclaim Moutesque. These are the final two modules of it. The Oblivion’s Edge Wraith is a fallen Mage of the Order, they are the field commander these modules.. The Library will be outside with 2 massive Rope Lights. There will be 2 levels of the Library andhe Followup module to this will be outside with the Ropelights too but will be more in a perfect Square to rep a Graveyard with multiple waves of monsters where the Library is a more enclosed battle with a odd layout.
