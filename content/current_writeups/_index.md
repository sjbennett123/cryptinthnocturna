description: So for the hook for the whole weekend, I was thinking the regular reports from Moutesque have been very vague and scattered over the last 3 years. The last letter received was dated in February of 623 (about 4 months ago) and now a distress call was sent out to the Ducal Watchtowers to send aid that Moutesque has went silent. People suspect Valdrick has his hand in the game but other rumors are the Feral have found a way to compromise the balance between Cryptinth and Moutesque

    Hail good heroes of Elysia! My name is Kyumiri Cryptinith, the Lord Reeve of Cryptinith, servant of the former Duke Ryldinmar of Elysia. These past 3 years have been hard on us all, but we in Cryptinith have endured the storm. I’m sure you all are aware of the city of Moutesque and that the Dark Tower holds. A troubling omen indeed, it has been 3 months since the last report had arrived on my desk from the order of mages who guard the tower. The Cryptinith family have been charged with overseeing the Dark Tower and it’s surroundings should the Order of Oblivions Edge go silent. 
    
    This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinith. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinith. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous ￼on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinith as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.
    
    The rumors from Moutesque have been Valdrick's forces have invaded but I have not seen any signs of full invasion yet. Another rumor we have been investigating are the Feral have been working with an unknown force to compromise the balance between Moutesque and Cryptinith.
    
    I wish you all safe travels and look forward to meeting all of you in the coming week!

    Adopted son of former Duke Ryldinmar
