description: So for the hook for the whole weekend, I was thinking the regular reports from Moutesque have been very vague and scattered over the last 3 years. The last letter received was dated in February of 623 (about 4 months ago) and now a distress call was sent out to the Ducal Watchtowers to send aid that Moutesque has went silent. People suspect Valdrick has his hand in the game but other rumors are the Feral have found a way to compromise the balance between Cryptinth and Moutesque
