**Brief:**

​	A hunter collecting the rat tail bounty is seeking help in clearing out a large rats nest he found in a cave.



**Requirements:**

​	None



**Synopsis:**

​	A hunter collecting the rat tail bounty comes into town looking for a group to help clear out a nest he found. There are more rats than he can handle, and is willing to share the bounty. When the PCs get to the cave, there is a large colony of rats feeding off of dozens of people that have been thrown in the cave,. Painted around the cave at about head height are several bloody fists painted in rust- red blood. The bodies are in varying states of decay, some fresh and some very old, mostly adults, but some small skeletons can be seen beneath larger ones. The rats are feeding on the flesh and are bloodstained. Fights occasionally break out among the colony as the eat. These rats appear larger than their grain-fed cousins. As the PCs approach, the rats will abandon their food and attack. Unlike the other rats, these will attack first, without being provoked. These rats are super aggressive. 



**Outcomes:**

- The PCs clear the rats out of the area

- The PCs leave the rats

  

**Rumors:**

- **[ANNOUNCED]** There is a bounty on rats in the city, and the city will pay one silver for every two rat tails harvested.

- **[COMMON]** Large packs of giant rats have been seen roaming around the city. They are drawn by garbage and decay, and are large enough colonies to cause a problem for lone or small groups of travelers.
