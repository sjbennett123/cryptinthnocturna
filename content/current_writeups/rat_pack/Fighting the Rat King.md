ATTENTION! ATTENTION! 

The City of Stonewood thanks you for your participation in harvesting the hoard of rats terrorizing the city. Just a few moments ago, a Rat King was discovered! The City of Stonewood implores every able bodied adventurer to assist the city in eradicating these rats, and will pay one silver per rat killed! Thank you for your participation.

The PCs discover a large colony of rats in a large, dug out den with multiple tunnels running from the main chamber. The chamber is full of Bloody Rats. At the rear of the chamber, there is a mass of rats not moving around a whole lot and are fighting between themselves. This is the Rat King. These rats are joined by the tail, almost on top of one another.
