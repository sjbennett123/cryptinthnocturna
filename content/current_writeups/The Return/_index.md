  - Post-Reset Saturday

description: Sundown in Cryptinith is a bit more chaotic than normal. The Feral have gone on the hunt for anyone they see outside the City Gates before Nightfall, though something has forced their Transformation earlier…
synopsis: Shortly after Reset on Saturday, something sends the Feral into a killing frenzy. What is worse is their Transformations have been sparked before the moon is up! This is a result of all the Chaos Energy in the area and the Star of Nekron acting as a amplifier for the Moon’s natural Lunar Tide on the Feral. All once howls pierce the air and the Feral ALL transform at once, ascending to their warform they call “Chrinos” The Torches have not been lit yet so the Feral can freely rush the City Gates and attack, this has NEVER happened before…
  The module will start with all NPCS who can play Feral going to separate  ends of the camp and Howling followed by a Transform 3 Count, a Marshall will call “ALL TRANSFORMS UP” when the FERAL approach as they feel the Chaotic energy from them. At the time of ALL TRANSFORMS UP call, a timer is set for 30 minutes. 
outcomes: 
  - The PCs stop the attacking waves of Feral and put an end to them
  - The Feral start to slaughter everyone and word is sent to Hakkens Blade for reinforcements to guard the City
  - The PCS outlast the Feral’s bloodlust of 30 minutes

The Feral

*You are the apex predator, the Feral strike fear into the hearts of the weak and strong. Though one by one they might not be as terrifying as other Lycans, their pack tactics and sheer aggression set them apart from your average Lycan. Unlike other Lycans who just mindlessly kill, they go for infection over evisceration. They will still kill if enraged or the target is too persistent about not dying, but they Feral prefer to Bite you and let you succumb to the Lunacy of the Beast under a Full Moon to join their ranks. While they seem just like incredibly bloodthirsty savage berserkers, they are quite intelligent despite the berserker tendency in their blood on their hunting. During the day you are a normal person just with anger issue, but at night you become a Feral again with almost no control over your Transformation unless inside the City Gates of Cryptinth*

Feral Lycan (Grey Werewolves, Brown Werebears, Black Werepanthers)

Body: 200

Defenses: Revive unless killed by Silver, Immune to Charm, Immune to Curse, Immune to Sleep, Immune to Create Undead Spell, Rips from Pin/Bind/Web/Confine, Threshold 5, Double Damage from Silver, Return x5, Dodge x2, Cloak Chaos x3, Resist Poison x5



Magic: None

Weapons: Claws

Damage: 10 Normal/Silver/Magic (May switch depending on what they are facing. Silver vs other Lycans, Magic vs Undead, Normal for anything else.)

Abilities: Arcane Fear x3 (Must Howl Before), Spellstrike Harm Undead 30 x5, Spellstrike Destroy Undead x5, Critical Slay (Massive) x1, May inflict Curse of Transformation on 3 count bite to unconscious or dead NPC/PC at will, **Arcane Berserk x1**, Cure Mortal Wounds 40 x3 (Touch Cast), Physical Strike: Destroy x3, Physical Strike: Pin x3, Physical Strike: Bind x3, 

**SPECIAL NOTES: FERALS CANNOT BE CALMED OR PURIFIED BLOOD FROM BERSERK. CoT non-Ferals can be Calmed but not Purified Blood from their berserker rage** 

Killing Blow Active: No, Feral would rather infect CoT than Killing Blow to spread their kind on others. If you down someone and you can, perform a 3 count Bite to inflict a CoT on your victim

Motivations: SPREAD LYCANTHROPY!!! The Feral are relentless and terrifying. They inflict their madness on other and see how strong the spirit is to fight off the Lunacy of the Beast. Those who cannot fight off the Beast become Feral, those who fight off the Beast still walk the path of the Lycan and are tested each Full Moon of their spirit. Any undead will be smited where they stand despite your berserk rage, just because you are a mindless berserker doesn’t mean your have the primal urge to fight Undead like all Lycans.
