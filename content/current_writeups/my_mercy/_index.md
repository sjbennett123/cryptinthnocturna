One of the Siblings set some makeshift traps and held the advance of the off, they wrote a note and attempted to make a break for it but one was captured and “Harvested” by the Lord of the Woods and returned to “the Cave” hold up in a small passageway, they await hope as a cultist took the message recklessly and went towards town with greed in their eyes.

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Movements at night time of what appear to be Wild Elves and Barbarians mostly, a few Humans among them, have been spotted to the West of Stonewood. If you get close to them, they will stop and stare at you but wont advance unless you do. Speaking with them has not gained much result yet, they seem to me stalking something or seeking something. The most distinguishing marks we can find of them is that they have Black and Green markings on their faces in the shape of vines and leaves.”

running_notes: This module starts out as a random encounter seemingly. One of the 5 Cultists has a Map to “the Cave” North of Stonewood that the siblings are hold up in. They PCs will loot the map upon defeating the roaming Cultists. The PCs are free to engage in this module how they wish. They can 1) gather a team and hunt the Cave down to save them, 2) Go alone or small squad to rescue them, or 3) ignore the map completely and write it off which the Lord of the Woods kills the siblings just before Sunrise. The Siblings hold the location of where the “Vine people” have been sighted coming and going from but can only take them there in the daytime, too unsafe at night and hard to find. They also overheard the Lord of the Woods Cultist about a group called the “Circle of Blackened Thorns” that is linked to the Lord of the Woods they think but no other information.
