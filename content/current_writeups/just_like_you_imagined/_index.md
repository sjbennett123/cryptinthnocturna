author: Scott Bennett
layout: module
description: Balor investigated a bloody fist Urukhai and discovered that some formal magic caused the black shadow to show up and kill everyone in the circle. Turns out some people need to learn that lesson themselves. 
schedule: reaction
requirements: 
  - Casting formal magic on the spirit of an Urakhai warror.
synopsis: > 
  This stuff goes in the Zine

  Other than Orcs identify as Celestial, Earth, and Arcane (dragon magic)
  
  Cantrips are fine though. They tried various cantrips and they went off without issue

  Balor found this out the hard way when the Earth guild tried to DFM
  The spirit of a Orc and it horridly backfired. They thought it was a fluke and tried again and same result
  
  Even a celestial DFM was tried
  
  So 3 attempts both schools same result
