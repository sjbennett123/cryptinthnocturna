synopsis: The Tavern was the most human part of Moutesque. Oblivion’s Edge members would come here to drink and calm their nerves. The network of checks and balances of security in Moutesque is normally very tight and seamless. But Demitri Revendreth found a way to ruin all of these years of careful planning.
