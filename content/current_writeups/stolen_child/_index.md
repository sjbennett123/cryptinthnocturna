schedule: saturday early afternoon

description: A child is taken from in front of his parents. The father chases the group to a cave out of town. He has returned to try to find help in retrieving his child.
synopsis:   |
  A distraught father, Varyn Gilchek comes running into town. He can be heard calling for help from a far distance [ex. Please! You have to help me! Someone! They took him!]
  When stopped and after he recovers from his run, he tells who ever will listen that, ex. “Some people. They just snatched little Charlie right out from in front of our home!” He produces a smudged paper with a shepherd's crook [Tarrasch] symbol that was left in the wake of the kidnapping. If questioned thoroughly, and if pressed for a reason, the father will admit that he couldn't pay his tithe to the Bloody Fist, due to poverty, and assumes his son was taken in payment.
  He followed the kidnappers into the wilderness surrounding Stonewood and to a cave with a small entrance. After pausing for breath, he realized that he ran into a fight with no weapons and no backup. Reluctantly, he doubled back to town with the hope of gathering a party to help rescue his son. 
  The party will collect horses [start the travel for the mod at the NPC shack]. A good horse could cover this distance in about 25 minutes. Once travel is complete, the PCs will have arrived at the cave. Total time the child has been gone 4.5hrs+pc gathering time. While the father sought help, the child was killed. The child's body should be placed at the back of the cave, sitting on the floor, covered with a sheet. The body should be of a toddler sized child with the Tarrasch symbol painted on their forehead.
  The cave has a narrow entrance [two door stoppers to hold the door steady]. If possible, a low entrance should be created using a black plastic tarp covering the doorway, forcing the PCs to duck as low as a crouch. 
  When the PCs enter the cave, they are set upon by the Tarrasch Pawns, then the Bishop. The Bishop needs to flee when there is a likely chance of being beaten, such as few pawns left, etc.  Each Black Pawn will give a silver, each White Pawn a gold, the bishop multiple gold.
  If the Tarrasch win the fight, someone is marked by the Tarrasch in blood and the rest are left for dead/ or are stabilized/robbed/etc. When robbed, the Bishop will rob the PCs of their magic items and keep them on his person. 
  If the PCs are able to eliminate the Tarrasch in the cave, they still have lost the child.
  The child's father, if he survives, will be understandably upset and should act heartbroken, etc. He will remove the child's body from the cave and want to bury him.
