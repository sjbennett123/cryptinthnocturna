description: After being charged with finding Charlie, the PCs can track him using Craftsman:Other[Level 1 or above] back to the cache of the Felhand, where he is standing guard. He will give up his post easily if found. At 12pm Saturday he will abandon his post if not found.
Requirements: 
 - Completion of HELP WANTED or before 12pm Saturday
Synopsis: Granny Linda was very helpful in describing her grandson and now the PCs are able to track Charlie to his hideout, the cache of the Felhand. Charlie is on guard duty at the cache and has been for the past three days. He ran out of drink early on in his duty, and is in desperate need of a bottle. The closer to noon it gets, the more anxious he gets and he will get increasingly agitated and short tempered, and will abandon his watch at 12 pm Saturday, making his way into the tavern in search of a bottle and maybe a card game. Unfortunately for Charlie, he is sober, outnumbered  and out-weaponed. He will try to bluff his way into getting them to leave and if that doesn't work, he will run rather than fight. The treasure is left unguarded and free for the taking if the PCs wish.
Outcomes:
- The PCs are able to track Charlie to his post in the woods and convince or threaten him into leaving his duty.
- The PCs don't track Charlie and he shows up in the tavern after 12pm Saturday module failure, spawns module YOU FOUND CHARLIE
