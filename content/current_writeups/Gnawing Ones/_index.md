Motivation: Feed on the trees of stonewood. Feed on the fear of their prey.

If someone is paralyzed the gnawing ones will killing blow them BUT they make sure that their prey is actually paralyzed and take their time making sure that victim can watch. They feed on the fear that is generated by their foes seeing them prepare the killing strike.  The mind is moving at million miles a minute but the body is frozen in place. The fear marinates the mind with chemicals that the gnawing ones find particularly delicious and sustaining. 

Repelled by the banners of the bloody fist. The latent psychic energy of rage and hate that boils withing the banners of the fist repel the Gnawing ones.
