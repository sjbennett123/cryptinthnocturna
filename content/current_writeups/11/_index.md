The Journey to El’Dorado

**Written by:** Chris Colland

**Reviewed by:** Scott Bennett




 **Brief**: 5 Kindom warriors pass through town on the way to a crypt that they heard about. While they are town, they tell tales of the surrounding countryside before venturing into the crypt.




 **Requirements:** 

·    Saturday Morning

**Synopsis**: A group of 5 Soldiers are following a rumor of a deadly undead crypt. They explain that they are hunting some high powered undead in the region but tell the PCs that they are well suited for this danger. They do not want any PCs to come with them, they are confident they can handle any issues that arise. They also refuse to stay to deal with the “Orc Situation” having undead to deal with which serve a far greater threat to the kingdom than some measly Orcs. 

**Outcomes**: 

(1) After about an hour they depart for the fabled crypt to slay the Undead.

**Rumors**:

Deep in the Stonewood hills there is a Wretched Crypt with a sleeping undead. This undead is dangerous but not if you take the proper precautions. His weakness is simply the primary color, yellow. If you prominently wear this into his crypt and do not bring any perishable food, you will not wake him, and while he slumbers, he will fall quickly to your blade.

The Journey to El’Dorado: Henri Kincade

 

You are a tough and capable fighter. However, this tough facade crumbles when the time allows. You are the oldest of your 3 siblings and joined the King’s Army out of a sense of honor and duty after your parents were killed by a necromancer Odomach. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)

You are from Ebbonmar Originally, moving to Glavorn when you turned 6 years old. Your mother Aalice and Father Michel were performers and moved the family to Glavorn to build a better life. Ten years ago, your mother and father were both killed during a traveling show. An undead horde, led by a necromancer Odomach, killed almost everyone in the theater, and turned them all into undead. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”) You then put aside your ambitions in the theater and joined the King's army. Your younger siblings Carlee and Yosef also fled the performing troupe massacre, and joined the king’s army to fight the undead horde to protect the lands and people still living.

You are focused on getting your team out of whatever trouble they get into. You are very attached to Genevieve and would not like to see anything evil befall her. You have even stated to learn earth magic as an attempt to spend more time with her.

 

**Performer**: You still hold a love of the theater in your heart would love to have someone read lines for you. A few of these works are in the sections titled Le Roi en Jaune,

The Journey to El’Dorado: Genevieve Starbeck

 

You aspired to be a singer in the Glavorn Playhouse since you were a small child. You were fascinated by the stage, and your family were wealthy patrons of the playhouse giving you access to many shows and actors. Your parents had you tutored in the art of singing and dance but acting is where your heart lays. 

You studied with Michel Kincade at the Glavorn Playhouse for many years, and when asked, you decided to go on a traveling show that was overrun by undead necromancer Odomach one fated evening. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)

You fled with Henri, and a few other survivors. After a time, you enlisted in the army with your friends, vowing to learn earth magics and destroy as many undead as possible. Your father protested, and has been looking for her ever since, not knowing where she disappeared to so many years ago.

 

**Hate Undead**: A practical encyclopedia of information about the undead and the many forms that the damnable creatures can take. You know all too well that once powered by necromantic energy they are more likely to trap other souls from going to great graveyard. This is your worst fear since the death of your parents. When talking to anyone recount facts from the section “A Dictionary of Undead”

The Journey to El’Dorado: Tangui Chavalie

 

You were born in Glavorn and met Henri when he was 6 years old. You ran through the streets of Glavorn, and his family took in the three Kincade siblings when their parents were killed and became undead. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)  Tangui and Henri joined the king’s army at the same time and have served together throughout their careers. They have fought in many engagements and are the closest of friends.

 

You learned healing from your father, Collyn, who worked with the Glavorn Healers guild. Also, spending time with your Uncle Eremon learning how to fight with a one-handed weapons and shield. Your mother, Cecilia, was happy to be a homemaker and wife to Collyn.

 

**Get back to the Kitchen**: Tangui despite his general good nature is a big fan of gender norms. He really doesn’t think that having one of his companions being a woman is going to do him any favors even if Henri gets kissy face about it.

**Lets play some Dice**: Carries a set of dice and is always willing to bet on a game. He will wager anything, being a vagabond with nowhere to call home he has very little to lose but loves the thrill of victory.

The Journey to El’Dorado: The Great Playhouse Massacre

The day of the massacre began as any other. It was the start of fall and the cold air was just starting to be the norm rather than the exception. The travelling troupe had canvassed the area the day before and the crowd was excited for the show. As the audience settled in and began to read their playbills you could hear a low groan coming from across the field. Then you saw it. The shambling horde of the undead approaching. They bore a banner with skull on it and they moved in silence save for the low chanting of their leader. 

The audience when they saw this panicked. It was Panamonium 

 

 

 

 

 

play began as a standard performance of the traveling troupe. The The theatergoers were given the playbill and gathered around for the performance when you heard booming drums from the woods.

Thale:    Then how do you know that he’s indisposed?

Well he must be indisposed if he isn’t here, don’t you think?

That’s one theory.

And your theory is what? 

Perhaps he has been detained. (To Camilla.) Perhaps he’s even been arrested. Perhaps his dear sweet sister…

(Aghast.) I deny it!!

… has him arrested on the orders of his unimpeachably honest uncle. 

Thale, will you stop torturing the girl? (To Camilla.) He saw the whole damned thing, your majesty Prince Aldones has sent me here ot arrest him for it. 

As Camilla and Alar beign to argue, Thale slips away from them. By alar’s second line he begins to chant “The Unseeing Eye”.) 

You can’t arrest Thale.

I beg your pardon? I was ordered to do it by a prince of the blood. Dmanit, how can I not arrest him? But you love him. Or you did.

And you don’t love your damned brother Uoht
