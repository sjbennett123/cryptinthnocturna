title: Laws of Cryptinith

---

These Laws are to PROTECT the citizens of Cryptinith, they may seem extreme in some regards but they have ensured us 20 years of peace and 20 more if they are followed. The “Feral” are to be slain and treated just like Undead as they have been known to conspire with them.

- All Lycans must be within the City Gates at sundown to be protected from Transformation. If you are found outside the City Gates and Transformed after dark, you will be assumed to be a “Feral” and will be slain if you do not comply. Feral cannot speak to non-Transformed Lycans. 
- No Silver Weaponry is to be displayed openly, if found openly displaying or brandishing silver weaponry, You will be fined and the weapon will be confiscated until you leave the City Gates
- No Silver Coin is to be spent on merchant wears within the City Walls. Offering to buy things with Silver Coin in the City Walls is illegal and will result in Silver being melted down. Please conduct Silver Coin exchanges outside the City Proper
- Slaying of a Lycan within the City Walls is strictly forbidden unless they are “Feral” or transform and attack you first. Feral who enter the City Walls know they will be impaled on Silver Spears as an example. 
- Aiding any agents of the Undead will result in public execution. NO EXCEPTIONS
- Do not invoke a Silver Aura spell on your blade within the City Walls unless attacked by “Feral” This will be considered a serious crime and treated as assault or attempted murder under the laws of Elysia otherwise.
- If a Lycan is transformed within the City Walls, you are to ask them “Who is the Duke? Do you respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith?” If the answer is “Duke Ezeal” or they refuse to respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith, they are to be struck down and put in chains of Silver untill they return to their senses. If they cannot respond to you, they are to be considered Feral and be Executed for their blatant acceptance of a wanted Outlaw of Elysia. If the Lycan is fully coherent and under control of themselves, they will be asked to drop their Transformation if possible and to answer with the current Dukes name as well as if they respect the authority of Ryldinmar Cryptinith. If all are in compliance then no crimes or punishment will be rendered upon the Lycan.
