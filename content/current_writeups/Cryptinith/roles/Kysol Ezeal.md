-Kissel Ezeal is the Alpha (leader) of the Feral, no one has seen him in years now but they fear he is still out there. His Beta of the Feral, Ulrick Firepaw has been very active as of these past 2 months since the reports from Moutesque have stopped coming out. If they Feral catch any Lycans transformed after Dark, they have a ritual they perform to sway them to their side and embrace their inner Lycan.
