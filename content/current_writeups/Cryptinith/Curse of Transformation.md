title: curse of transformation
---

If the Feral bite you, they can inflict a Curse or Transformation on you based on their Lycan type.

- The trigger for the CoT will be: Outside the City Gates of Cryptinth after dark. There will be a siren played and if you are caught outside the City Gates you will be forced into a Berserker State as your CoT comes tearing out. You will be handed a Stat card to add to yours, YOU WILL FIGHT EVERYTHING YOU SEE!
- Calm will bring them out of the Berserker state but they are Immune to Awaken
