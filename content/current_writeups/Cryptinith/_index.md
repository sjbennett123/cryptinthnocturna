- The Feral Lycans follow “Duke” Ezeal loyally in the wilds around Cryptinith. There have been a large increase of The Feral  as of recently. There have been reports over the years that Kissel Ezeal still lives and is the leader of The Feral but no-one can confirm this rumor
- EVERYONE IN CYRPTINTH ARE LYCANS
- There is a Magic on the town that protects it from transforming within the city walls. If you are outside of the city walls when the Sunsets, your Curse of Transformation will trigger and the Feral will come for you to recruit you. If you are inside the City Gates before sundown, despite the moonphase, you will be able to resist the call to Transform by the Moon
- Kissel Ezeal is the Alpha (leader) of the Feral, no one has seen him in years now but they fear he is still out there. His Beta of the Feral, Ulrick Firepaw has been very active as of these past 2 months since the reports from Moutesque have stopped coming out. If they Feral catch any Lycans transformed after Dark, they have a ritual they perform to sway them to their side and embrace their inner Lycan.
- The Lord Reeve, Kymiru Cryptinith, runs the town in Duke Rildemar’s stead. Even though retired, the former Duke is still a very busy man and leaves his affairs to his younger cousin who re-emerged after he accepted his Dark Elf Birthright.
