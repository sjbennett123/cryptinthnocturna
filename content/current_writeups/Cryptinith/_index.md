description: The Werewolf city ruled by Ryldinmar Cyrptinth
---

A small suburb of Montesque which is about a 15 Minute walk away. Cyrptinth is the home of Duke Ryldinmar Cyrptinth after his retirement. Even though he is retired, the former Duke is still busy and leaves his affairs to his younger cousin who re-emerged after he accepted his Dark Elf Birthright. The Lord Reeve, Kymiru Cryptinith, runs the town in Duke Ryldinmar's stead.

**Everyone in Cyrptinth is a lycan.** There is a Magic on the town that prevents anyone that has a Curse of Transformation from transforming within the city walls. If you are outside of the city walls when the Sunsets, your Curse of Transformation will trigger and the Feral will come for you to recruit you. If you are inside the City Gates before sundown, despite the moonphase, you will be able to resist the call to Transform by the Moon.
