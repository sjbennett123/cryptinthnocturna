This module is going to be difficult to pull off as the players will likely kill the Orc Scout with extreme prejudice. We will need to make a more convincing or easier way for the players to not want to attack the Orc and lure him in. 

Where will the Orc scout stay? What will he do when the charm wear off? What is to stop him from running or attacking then? 

Players cannot obtain enslavement potions or make them via alchemy onto antidotes

What information do we have on the “leak” in the woodcutters guild?
