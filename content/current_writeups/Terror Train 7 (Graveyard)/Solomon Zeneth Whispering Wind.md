The network of checks and balances of security in Moutesque is normally tight and seamless. But Demitri Revendreth found a way to ruin all of these years of careful planning.

The Oblivion’s Edge Wraith is a fallen Mage of the Order, they are the field commander these modules. The Skeleton Warlord are fallen Order Warriors and Mages. The Gravesinger is a “new” type of Undead that will become normal. The Gravesingers purpose is to PURELY heal and cast protectives on the Undead Hordes, he is essentially a weaponless Necromancer Healer.
