title: Chaos is a Ladder
Layout: module

author: Chris Colland
reviewer: Scott Bennett

schedule: saturday morning
weight: 1
plotline: 
requirements: 
  - First Module for the day

description: A portal has opened in the forest near Cryptinith to the Plane of Chaos, Chaos Imps and Chaos Knight come forth and roam looking for Order to destroy as they sensed the presence of Nobility.
synopsis: The presence of the Green Star, aka the Star of Nekron has made the veil between the Chaos Plane and Tyrra much thinner. Chaos Creatures are beginning to spawn from random portals in the Forest. The effect of the Chaos Rifts spawning is what is driving the Feral wild and into more of an uncontrolled Frenzy. Normally they kill with a purpose but now it is indiscriminately. These portals can’t be shut easily but they only last for a short period of time.

outcomes: 
  - The PCs engage the Chaos monsters and fight them back till the waves are over.
  - the PCs let the Chaos Creature go unchecked and they go deeper into the City to cause issue.
  - These Chaos Creatures become the randoms for the rest of the event.

  “Last night as of 2 past the Witching Hour, a dark green glowing Star appeared over Moutesque and Cryptinth. We will begin research into what this Star means and where it came from but this is a very unnatural occurrence for our area…

  ~Kyumiri Cryptinth
  High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth
  Adopted son of former Duke Ryldinmar
  Warden of Hakken’s Blade
  Defender of Cryptinth”

hook: None, This happens when NPCs are awake and ready

transformations: All Elemental Transforms UP
running_notes: This module is the wake up module for Saturday morning. The Star of Nekrons presence above Moutesque has lowered the veil between Chaos and Tyrra here. Given the movement and actions of the Chaotic One and the Star of Nekron, portals of Chaos have spawned in random patterns around Cryptinith and Moutesque. Having these creatures in the area sets the Feral on edge and increases their primal lust for battle. This is main module that becomes the daytime “Randoms” for Saturday. This first module the Imps will reset 5 times and the Knights will reset 3 times
