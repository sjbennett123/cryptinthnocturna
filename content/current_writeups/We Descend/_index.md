running_notes: This module starts the game and sets the mood for the weekend. As Lay On is called, the PCS are taken to the road where you turn up to the tavern at the edge of the road. When the call for Game On hit, the howls of the Feral and their glowing yellow eyes come alive as the PCs begin to march, this eerie chill will activate ALL MAGICAL BEAST TRANSFORMS. They must fight down the road to the Mod Shack and turn around back to the entrance. Once they make it back to where they started the last wave of Lycans will stop spawning. When the players defeat the remaining Feral, they may enter the tavern as normal, they will be told the Torches are active on the road now and to make their way to the Tavern, the Lord Reeve will be notified of their arrival

 **Requirements:** Friday Night 

 



 

**Outcomes**: (1) The PCs fight their way to the Tavern inside the City Gates of Cryptinth

(2) The Feral keep them outside of town and attempt to take them all captive as they aren’t known travelers in the lands

 

**Rumors:** “This is a call for aid to the Heroes or Elysia! Something sinister is afoot in the shadows of Moutesque. We have our own share of problems with the Feral lurking in the forests outside of Cryptinth. STICK TO THE ROADS ON YOUR WAY HERE AND DO NOT TRAVEL AT NIGHT ALONE!!! Make sure you bring Silver weapons….. but please do not carry them openly in the city walls of Cryptinth. I shall post the laws of our city very soon. This expeditionary force will rendezvous ￼on the 2nd of June 623. You may use our city of Cryptinth as your forward base as the city of Moutesque is not habitable to anyone besides the mages of Obilvions Edge.”

~Kyumiri Cryptinth, High Lord Reeve of Cryptinth

The Feral

*You are the apex predator, the Feral strike fear into the hearts of the weak and strong. Though one by one they might not be as terrifying as other Lycans, their pack tactics and sheer aggression set them apart from your average Lycan. Unlike other Lycans who just mindlessly kill, they go for infection over evisceration. They will still kill if enraged or the target is too persistent about not dying, but they Feral prefer to Bite you and let you succumb to the Lunacy of the Beast under a Full Moon to join their ranks. While they seem just like incredibly bloodthirsty savage berserkers, they are quite intelligent despite the berserker tendency in their blood on their hunting. During the day you are a normal person just with anger issue, but at night you become a Feral again with almost no control over your Transformation unless inside the City Gates of Cryptinth*

Feral Lycan (Grey Werewolves, Brown Werebears, Black Werepanthers)

Body: 100

Defenses: Revive unless killed by Silver, Immune to Charm, Immune to Curse, Immune to Sleep, Immune to Create Undead Spell, Rips from Pin/Bind/Web/Confine, Threshold 5, Double Damage from Silver, Return x5, Dodge x2, Cloak Chaos x3, Resist Poison x5



Magic: None

Weapons: Claws

Damage: 10 Normal/Silver/Magic (May switch depending on what they are facing. Silver vs other Lycans, Magic vs Undead, Normal for anything else.)

Abilities: Arcane Fear x3 (Must Howl Before), Spellstrike Harm Undead 30 x5, Spellstrike Destroy Undead x5, Critical Slay (Massive) x1, May inflict Curse of Transformation on 3 count bite to unconscious or dead NPC/PC at will, **Arcane Berserk x1**, Cure Mortal Wounds 40 x3 (Touch Cast), Physical Strike: Destroy x3, Physical Strike: Pin x3, Physical Strike: Bind x3, 

**SPECIAL NOTES: FERALS CANNOT BE CALMED OR PURIFIED BLOOD FROM BERSERK. CoT non-Ferals can be Calmed but not Purified Blood from their berserker rage** 

Killing Blow Active: No, Feral would rather infect CoT than Killing Blow to spread their kind on others. If you down someone and you can, perform a 3 count Bite to inflict a CoT on your victim

Motivations: SPREAD LYCANTHROPY!!! The Feral are relentless and terrifying. They inflict their madness on other and see how strong the spirit is to fight off the Lunacy of the Beast. Those who cannot fight off the Beast become Feral, those who fight off the Beast still walk the path of the Lycan and are tested each Full Moon of their spirit. Any undead will be smited where they stand despite your berserk rage, just because you are a mindless berserker doesn’t mean your have the primal urge to fight Undead like all Lycans.
