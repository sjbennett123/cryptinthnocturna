running_notes: This module starts the game and sets the mood for the weekend. As Lay On is called, the PCS are taken to the road where you turn up to the tavern at the edge of the road. When the call for Game On hit, the howls of the Feral and their glowing yellow eyes come alive as the PCs begin to march, this eerie chill will activate ALL MAGICAL BEAST TRANSFORMS. They must fight down the road to the Mod Shack and turn around back to the entrance. Once they make it back to where they started the last wave of Lycans will stop spawning. When the players defeat the remaining Feral, they may enter the tavern as normal, they will be told the Torches are active on the road now and to make their way to the Tavern, the Lord Reeve will be notified of their arrival
