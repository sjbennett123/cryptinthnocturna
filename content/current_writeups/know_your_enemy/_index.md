  “Adventurers and Allies of the United Stonewood Effort, I hope your Winter was not too unbearable. The good Baron Hadukkel has begun efforts to fortify us against the inevitable Bloody Fist attack in 3 weeks time. We at the Black Anvil Mercenary Company will do what we can to assist him and Stonewood. Our scouts and soldiers, at great costs during the Winter months, have gathered a collection of our best knowledge of the Bloody Fist and will be delivering it you once the Adventurers have been gathered at Markets beginning. We believe this information will be critical in Knowing the Enemy we will be facing. This battle will not be resolved in a matter of days. Orcs love to wage war for an extended period of time, but if we can cut atleast one head off this snake then we can buy ourselves time till the next strikes.”

  Be safe and bring your best weapons and healers, Tyrras grace we will need them,

  Balor Ironleaf

  Captain and Guildmaster of the Black Anvil Mercenary Company
