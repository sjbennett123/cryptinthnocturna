## Nekrotis-Gul the Unbound

In life, the Chaotic One was known as Draven Sundarr of Sundarr City in Woodhaven. He was a noble and honorable knight in Elysia in the first days of its founding 40 some years ago. In his older age, he was tempted by Chaos when he was disillusioned by the Nobility and the lack of ambition in Elysia. 

A Chaos Knight known as Nekrotis-Gul the Unbound, offered to fuse himself to Draven if he pledged to bring Elysia to a state of “Paradise”. His vision of paradise is simple. Overthrow Elysian rule and sit upon the throne ushering in an Era of Disorder and Chaos destroying the “Corrupted Order” of Elysian Nobiliy.  Draven was enthralled by power and the ability to take charge as he saw fit. He accepted the gift and went to the Chaos plane with Nekrotis-Gul. Together they fused their souls into one armor clad shape.  His new name was unpronounceable by any Tyrran tongue so his true name became Nekrotis-Gul the Unbound but on Tyrra he is known as “The Chaotic One” or “The Green-Eyed Demon”

## Children of the Stars

The Chaotic One” had spent the past 3 years building up an underground cult of disillusioned people in Elysia. These followers were not thrilled with how they were “abandoned” and “left to die” or were asking “where was our nobility, we faithfully served” . The Star of Nekron cult promises to “Break the Chains” that shackle Elysian citizens to their current caste and not allow them to rise in status. 

The cult is known outwardly as the Children of the Stars but among themselves they are known as the “Star of Nekron”.  The cult's symbol is a green and white star tattooed on the forearm, neck, hand, or forehead. 

They follow the Green Star of Hope which appeared over Moutesque and Cryptinth recently. Once enough faith in the “Green Star” has been raised, the Star of Nekron appears in an area and collect all energy they siphon to the cause. The cultist refer to the “Green Eyed One” as their patron “Spirit” that will return Elysia to “Balance” if pressed they will only utter the name “Krotis-Gul” The cover story they have is he was a Warrior of Elysia some almost 40 years ago who disappeared into the Fae Realm and has been seen recently as to return. It sounds like they are kinda crazy about their devotion in this hero but they are 100% in their belief in it. 

The “Speakers of Nekron” are the spiritual leaders who guide the followers to focusing all their “hate” and “disillusionment” into pure energy and give it up to Nekron whom they believe is a profit that will “Deliver them a Paradise from Elysian suffering” 

The cult structure is simple: Nekron is above all, the Speakers of Nekron guide the way, the Blade of Nekron protect them, and the Followers are known as Children of the Stars

One of the blessings Krotis-Gul gives to his “true” followers is the Immunity to Charm and Enslavement because theyvalue of free will above all.

## The Four Fiends

To do this, he intends to creat eupon 4 powerful “Fiends'' to do his bidding and secure his ascendancy. To create the 4 Fiends, Draven must “free” a powerful spirit from the Dark Tower and split its power into 4 then fuel them with his cult, the Children of the Stars .

- Mar’Kel the Flame Serpent (Fire), 
- Gigas the Titan (Earth), 
- Hydrosus the Drowned (Water), 
- Tal’Deth the Cloudstrider (Air) 

Seeing some of Valdricks troops left behind in Elysia after the Crystal Barrier, he began searching for the Key to the Dark Tower of Montesque. When he discovered the location of the original, someone had beaten him to it but a note was left with specific instructions on how to get a “One Time Access Key” to the Tower. To gain access to this key, Draven approached Valdricks forces and offered them a return to their master if they helped him gain the Key Copy. After some discussion of the terms, Valdricks forces allied themselves with Draven until the deal was done.
