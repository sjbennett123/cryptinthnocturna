It is missing a hand, and it is tied off with a tourniquet, leaving a bloody stump where the hand should have been. On the forehead, drawn in blood, is the symbol of the Tarrasch. There is a rumor about a bloody symbol found on the forehead of the slain and tortured.  As the group surveys the scene, they are descended upon by a group of BLOODY RATS, drawn to the scene by the blood. The rats attack the PCs, leaving behind a rat tail for every rat killed.

running_notes: The slain cheesemaker has been badly beaten and tortured before being dumped on the trail. The wife was on her way to look for her husband, as he never took this long getting home on Friday. She was on her way to the tavern, as she knew there was a market and hoped he'd be there.  The BLOODY RATS should fight as a group, driven by food. In this case, the food is the dead body and any PCs that should go down. They should fight aggressively, and be protective of the food.
