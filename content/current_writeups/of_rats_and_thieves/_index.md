synopsis: > 
  Luca Norwish,a friendly adventurer, is looking for a party to adventure with at the start of the market. He and his wife have traveled to stonewood looking for their share of loot. He tells the PCs where they are staying and details about his previous life. He has with him a message from a farmer, looking for someone to help him clear out a rat pack that is eating his seed grain. He possesses a large amount [10%] and is worried about losing it. The PCs go to the farm and are greeted by Gerald, the farmer. He explains that he has a large bag of seed grain for spring planting, and the rats are strongly attracted to it. He can no longer manage them on his own and is so glad that the PCs are there. 
  
  
  He leads them to a room where to where the rats are. They are meandering around the room and occasionally going to the bag of grain and removing a piece. The rats will not attack unless they are attacked first or if the grain bag is disturbed. The farmer will encourage the PCs to kill the docile rats anyway. Once the rats are cleared, Gerald ,the farmer, will go into the room and make sure they are all dead. All the cast members playing rats that have cycled through their resets gather outside and change costumes removing their masks and top tabards. The cast members then respawn as The Tarrasch. Gerald, the farmer, turns to face the doorway so the PCs back is to the door. Gerald, the farmer, thanks the PCs and inspects the leftover grain. While doing this he will make small talk and explain the rat tail bounty that the SCPSD has put in placek. 
  
  
  As the PCs are talking to the farmer, the Tarrasch storm into the room trying to beat down the and rob the players. Once the PCs are down, they are searched for magic items, money and Rat Tails. These items are kept on the Bishop until end of event. Luca is abducted, the rest are stabilized and left with a note , and then left in the room. The farmer is caught in the crossfire and dies.
