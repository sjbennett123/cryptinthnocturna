Rumors: | 
  - [COMMON] A symbol has been sighted at gristly crimes. Usually drawn in blood on the forehead of the slain and tortured, it has been likened to a shepherd's crook.
  - [UNCOMMON] There are always bodies being found, but lately the bodies bare signs of immense torture before being returned to their families.
  - [UNCOMMON] People are randomly disappearing, from their beds, the streets, in front of their families... People fear the night and what stalks it
