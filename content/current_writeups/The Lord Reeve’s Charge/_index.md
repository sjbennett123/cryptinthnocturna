After the conclusion of this module, the NPCS will prepare the Mod Shack for 5 'Terror Train' modules to go back to back depending on the speed and intensity the players want to go at. These can be rapid fire or short interludes in between. This will take up the majority of the Afternoon to Early Evening Reset.
