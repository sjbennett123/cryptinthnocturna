Lil bristle took it took credit for the work that the adventurers did and named the beer after himself. The players are invited to his bithday party / brewery bash to kick off the weekend. Then the fucking orcs attack. 

Just come marching down the road. Like, i don't know if you guys haven't seen this camp but there's a big road that walks right down into the tavern where we can walk right over this big hill. And there's this huge flood light out in the yard and if they just see 30 orcs walking out of the darkness with like we wrap like glow sticks around, like things like torches and shit. 

And the goal for the orc is to get Steven's characters and mayor and drag his ass out in the field. 

These guys went in, they gave Mary, you stand down or you die. Stephen started writing out his surrender note and then he just ate it so they killed it. But i was like, okay they're gonna memory poisoning and they're gonna let him rest. That's what they started to do them. Like no, no, no, no, let's do this. And i like messed around with a bunch of stuff and they like the killed, an orc, and they put the orc dagger, like in Steven's characters hand. So and then the awarded the building. So Steven was stuck inside for five.

he ate the orc
