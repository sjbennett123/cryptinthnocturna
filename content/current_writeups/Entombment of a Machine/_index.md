  - The Prophets Beckoning has been ran

description: Oblivion's Edge used the unrelenting might of Golems to patrol and upkeep the town. Now the Golems have begun to malfunction and attack anyone they see instead of just the Undead. Solomon Zeneth returns to seek aid in fixing this.

synopsis: Solomon Zeneth comes to the adventurers VERY concern as his Golems have started to malfunction. These Undead normally stalk the darkness of Moutesque sensing out the Undead threats and smiting them where they stood. However, with the Golem Master slain, the failsafe in the Golems is no longer easy to enable. In the process of trying to disable some of the Golems as they were needing to recharge, the Golems malfunctioned and have gone into the town of Moutesque hunting but they are fighting anything they find and not the Undead. These Golems were CRITICAL in surviving as long as they did against Dimitri Revendreth
outcomes: 
  - The PCs destroy the Golems and stop their indiscriminate killing
  - The PCs cannot stop them or don’t find all the Golems, if any of the 5 escape then they will become a roaming monster till killed.
