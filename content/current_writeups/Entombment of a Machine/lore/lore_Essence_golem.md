## If an Essense Golem is investigated by anyone with Craftman Other Golem Making.

The Essence Golems were created by fusing a  permanently Transformed Undead Hunter, the fresh heart of a Life Elemental, and the inactive body of a Diamond Golem. These Golems were built to hunt Undead in particular and ward off any corrupted death based creatures. They are costly to make and maintain given their cost of creation.
