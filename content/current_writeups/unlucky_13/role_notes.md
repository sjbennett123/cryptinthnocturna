This floor is unique as in it is a custom monster. This floor is an all-out sword fight. They are very resilient to Magic and normal takedown moves PCs would us to take out monsters or PVP. This is one they will just have to cut through and use tactics to win with shield wall and defense over spells and cheap tricks.

**Don’t SPAM attack your Deaths!** Think of how the fairness of the module is going and who they have on it. This is also Floor 10 so the players will be ran very thin on skills and exhausted. This floor is VERY hard but should drop a Magic Item if beaten.

 

This Floor is a massive checkpoint in the Dungeon, if the 6-person group can defeat this floor then they can clear floors 11-13 with high success chance.

Unlike normal Banshees, these can be killed like normal when they are dropped to Zero and Killed Blowed ONLY in Mausoleum cause of the ancient training magics

Add Return x10

 

Add Cap 10

 

**No Respawns in the Mausoleum. Once you are dead you are dead unless the other NPCS can bring you back using their skills if intelligent enough to do so**

 

**THIS IS THE FINAL FLOOR!!!!** This NPC playing the True Giant will be alone but you will be VERY powerful vs a group of 6 very worn down PCs who have fought through 12 level of absolute hell to face you! Your main call is Massive for your weapon swing so PCs will be terrified of you unless they invoke carrier immunity if they remember during your relentless assault.

 

Remember your Slays/Parrys: The PCs will most likely see you and attempt to empty all assassinate/slays into you to drop your body quickly. Use your Parrys as defenses against 200 Blade Flurrys and Assassinates

 

**CAP 10 will level the playing field for you vs people swinging over 10 damage in one hit!** This will make the PCs more likely to use spells and slays/assassinates but it will draw out the battle more to make it feel more Epic so use this to enjoy the scene.

The True Giant in this room is very old, his name is Grund’el the Silent, he is the son of Tho’rek the Terrible who Feaolin Ironleaf died to defeat in ancient Stonewood. Grund’el has been down here many years, trapped by ancient Dwarven magic to make sure Tho’rek’s blood ended here. When Grund’el was banished here he was but a child. Legend was at the time True Giants could only be killed by two things: 1) old age and 2) a weapon forged of the land of Stonewood and the elements themselves could unmake such a mighty beast to break their semi-immortality.

 

IF and WHEN the PCs manage to defeat the Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes, they will all be granted a Magic Item of their custom making (within plot approval) and the title of “Champion of Stonewood” which is held in almost the same regard as nobility. In addition, they will be able to wield and use the artifact weapon Foereaver if Stonewood is in imminent danger with the condition it is returned to Balor Ironleaf to be resealed in a new magical chamber built to contain it once it has been reforged.
