description: Faerune Leafdancer, Speaker of the Guilds, Voice of Runes Hammer has come to town to announce the reopening of the Guilds of Stonewood! In addition, there have been some additional guilds open to increase trade and prosperity across Stonewood and the greater Elysia during these trying times.
Requirements: Lunch Served
Synopsis:  Faerune Leafdancer will go over how the newly revised Guild structure will work in Stonewood. All names will be read of the new and existing guildmaster of Stonewood, new guilds established, and a huge thank you to the Adventurers for bolstering the spirits of the citizens to spring those who were willing to fight to action in aiding Balor and Magnus to recover the missing Guildmasters. Also the Mausoleum of Fallen Heroes is to be opened as a training ground filled with foes from Stonewood past battles, rumor is a great treasure awaits those who can conquer the final level in one attempt.
Outcomes: The Guilds are reopened and the citizens of Stonewood are able to financial recover from the attacks of the Bloody Fist. Also the Adventurers will be able to access Guild supplies and workshops now
Hook: Faerune comes to town at Lunchtime to announce the return of the Guilds and gathers all in attendance
Roles: Any of the Stonewood Townsfolk who are free and up for attending
Running Notes: This module is primarily a roleplay module. Reopening the Guilds allows the players to interact with them and production to be sold/traded for/requested/scrolls to be rented in Stonewood since this will be a major city in the plotline for years to come in Woodhaven. New guilds have been added to Stonewood to expand them as a trade city and line them up with Elysia more to make it more uniform when the Elysia wide guild system and guild passes come around allowing workshop access. Some of the local NPC guilds will remain NPC ran and controlled but the new and expanded guilds can change over time
Number of Cast Members: 1-5
