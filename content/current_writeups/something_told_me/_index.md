  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Strange figures and eerie green lights have been reported at night in the woods to West of Stonewood. If you get close to them, their lights fade and nothing is there if you investigate. Sometimes you can make out only a figure: a tall humanoid with some kind of antlers of horns on his head, wrapped in leathers and furs, a large 2 handed blade over his back.“

Hook: Lord of the Woods appears at the edge of town from the Taverns door surrounded in eerie green lights, on him spawn a group of wondering Cultists

running_notes: This module starts as a Random but has a spawn point. The Lord of the Woods spawns in an ethereal state unable to be harmed surrounded in Eerie Green Light. This will be a visual effect of the module beginning and a way to get attention of the players to draw them out of the Tavern. Once they have notice of the Lord of the Woods, he will call a spawn of his Cultists while will spawn from his “Green Aura” once spawned or if the PCs approach too close the “Green Aura” will disappear and the current spawn will be live. When all NPC are killed, they will reform on the Lord of the Woods and respawn at different points around the camp until the amount of resets have been reached or 2 PCs have been captured. If a PC is captured, they will be taken to the “Green Aura” of the Lord of the Woods and Rifted out on a normal 3 count to a secondary location where they will enter a roleplay encounter in a “Nightmare” included state where the Lord of the Woods  “harvest” dream energy from them and replace their dreams with “Nightmares” effectively giving them a “paranoia” effect till sunrise to grow his power and return their asleep body to a random spot on the campsite to wake up and rejoin the game.

Bring them back to the Lord of the Woods or his Blackened Tree and await his arrival to witness The Harvesting. Protect your captives fiercely, the stronger the Lord of the Woods becomes the stronger you become!

Terror: Having sleep spells cast on a target within the Presence of the Lord of the Woods or his Followers traps the victim within a nightmare of restless terror and helplessness.

Something Told Me: Lord of the Woods

You were once a proud knight of the Verdant Hedge but for your crimes you were outcast from your realm. Though you didn’t do the crimes you were accused of, and your honor remained intact, your sanity snapped along the way along with your will to be the hero. Now you have not necessarily become the villain but the anti-hero and will stop it nothing to harvest enough Dream Energy to wage your war on the Verdant Hedge and get them back for ruining your honor as a Knight that was the most loyal soldier they knew now become Fear Incarnate.

Card: You have no Stats on this module. You are in an ethereal state and unable to hurt people or be hurt. The only power you have is to keep those asleep or unconscious in a dream-like state fueled with nightmares while you harvest their dream energy to fuel your war of revenge on the Verdant Hedge.

Master of Dreams: Anyone in a Sleep effect in your line of sight can be harvested of Dream Energy on a 3 count. This leaves the target with a “Paranoia” effect until the next Sunrise comes to wash away their fears. You are also lethargic as if woken from a Night Terror for the next hour in game (no game mechanic, purely RP). Even if they see the sunrise and get restful sleep they still feel your cold angry caress in their mind for a few days after they have been harvested on.

Eerie Green Aura: If you are brought within the Lord of the Woods “Eerie Green Aura” while he is Ethereal, on a 3 count he can rift you out on touch to a Dream-like realm where he can harvest your Dream Energy. Once you have been “Harvested” the Lord of the Woods will return you to a random spot on the campsite to wake up and rejoin the game.
