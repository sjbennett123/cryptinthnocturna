description: Having met no resistance at the cache of the Tarrasch, the PCs return to Granny Silverlode to return her book and/or take word of her grandson to her.

synopsis: > 
  The finding of the book was easier than expected, plus there was a good haul of treasure for the taking. Granny is eager to get her book back, and if it shows up in town, Granny will send a messenger requesting that the group bring the book to her. 
  Once back at Granny's house, she will offer the group cookies and thank them profusely. She wants to hear all about their adventure and how they found her book. She will vehemently deny that her grandson had anything to do with her books disappearance and will change the subject if it is brought up. She also will not hear anything about where her grandson was found and with what. Effectively she stonewalls anyone who suggests her grandson isn't upstanding or hints at what he as been doing. She will also deny his drinking and gambling problems.
  If Huldrek makes it back to his Granny's separate from the PCs, he will be absent from the room. Granny claims he is in his bedroom resting.
  If the PCs bring back both the book and Huldrek, Huldrek will immediately try to leave to go to “his room”, and leaves after Granny searches him for coin
  Eventually, Granny will get annoyed that everyone is insisting her grandson stole her book and kick out the PCs or the PCs can leave freely, as long as they leave the book. Granny will pay the 20 Silver reward before they leave.
