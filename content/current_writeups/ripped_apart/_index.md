  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Lately there have been sightings of large feline claw marks into trees near Stonewood on the Eastern side. Reports of skirmishes but not much left but dead Bloody Fist Scouts and Orc blood everywhere. Sometimes there are drag marks for short or long distances but never consistent. Whatever this thing is, I am glad it is on our side…..”
