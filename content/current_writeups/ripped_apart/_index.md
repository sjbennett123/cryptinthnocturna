layout: module
author: Chris Colland
reviewer: Scott Bennett
schedule: friday night
weight: 5
description: Ripped apart, ripped apart on sight! Is what the Bloody Fist chanted when they grew tired of their prisoners, so now it comes time to flay their spirits from their physical form. This falls in line with the ideals of the Chieftain, the Hopeflayer. 
Outcomes:
  - The adventurers and Evermores come to their rescue and stop the ritual to flay their totem spirit from them.
  - The adventurers and Evermores don’t reach Henant and Tordex within 1hr, their totem spirit is stripped from their spirit and they are put into a unconscious state, will wake up Berserked after 20 minutes (and handed packets for spells)
Requirements: 
 - Welcome to Orctown has been ran 
 - After Bristle Bash
Synopsis:  >
  The Bloody Fist have obtained 2 high priority targets of Stonewood, Henant and Sir Tordex. They have beat and tortured them for information. The Bloody Fist wont enslave them because the Bloody Fist respect freedom and hate slavery, which is ironic considering they put Stonewood under their boot heels for over a year. 
  

   - Tordex was captured after about 7 days of scouting out Bloody Fist camps. Tordex has only been captured for about 3 days. Tordex luckily got most of his information back to a safe spot and his journals before his capture but has went radio silent for 3 days now. 
   - Henant was captured willingly to gather information on the Bloody Fist,  Henant has been captured the longer of the times about 7 days,The beating and torturing from Henant was much more personal given they have a much deeper past. Vel’Kaz personally took the banner Henant wears and told him to come get it back from him if he can. 
  
  
  But enough time has passed, upon hearing the news of Selketh being (killed or refused depending on how Welcome to Orctown plays out), they order the Transform spirits to their totems to be stripped from their bodies. Using all their willpower to reach out, Henant and Tordex unconsciously reach their totems which have had trouble finding them and the spirits travel to Stonewood Tavern to gather other to rescue them. This fight will be hard and get deadly quickly if they just rush in to grab the 2 captives. The players have 1 hour to save them from the ritual or their transform spirits will “flayed” from them. The Bloody Fist invoke a ritual to flay the spirit of their Totems from the captured, when the PCs show up, they will be faced with Honor Guard for the first time. 

Hook: Spirit Totem White Tiger enters the Tavern and informs the Evermores that their brother Henant and Tordex have been captured and they are attempting to strip the Totem Spirit

  A Message Posted on the Black Anvil Mercenary Scouting Watch Boards

  “Lately there have been sightings of large feline claw marks into trees near Stonewood on the Eastern side. Reports of skirmishes but not much left but dead Bloody Fist Scouts and Orc blood everywhere. Sometimes there are drag marks for short or long distances but never consistent. Whatever this thing is, I am glad it is on our side…..”
