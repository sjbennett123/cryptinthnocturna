title: Emergency! Help Wanted!
Layout: module

author: Brittney Perry

schedule: Saturday
plotline: Family Recipes
requirements: Finding and taking of the Tarrasch Chest in any way

description: Huldrek gave up the Tarrasch's treasure and went back to his grandmother's house. Huldrek is found by the Tarrasch, beaten, and allowed to go back into town to find the ones who stole their treasure and get it back. While planning, a note and a finger is sent into town; anything short of prompt payment by Huldrek will prove to be fatal for Granny. 
synopsis: |
  The Tarrasch treasure has been found, and now they are angry. Huldrek put up barely a fight on guard duty, and allowed the entire thing to be stolen. The Tarrasch quickly found Huldrek and beat him for information. He tells them what happened and that the adventurers in town have the treasure.
  Huldrek, beaten and bloody, is released into town to try and gather up all the treasure that was taken, including the box and all the “useless” treasure it contained. 
  While Huldrek is in town, a messenger is sent with a small box. Inside the box is a finger with a lock of gray “hair” tied around it and a note that says
  
  > Huldrek, how stupid can you be?
  > We want 75 Gold and the return of the rest of our treasure for the safe return of your grandmother.
  >Bring the gold and items to the drop point, alone.
  >We know about that adventuring scum in the city.
  >They need to stay out of this if you know what's good for you.
  >You have one hour.
  
  Huldrek will understandably become panicked and begs for help. He will be against anything except just taking the coin and treasure to the location alone. It will take convincing or being threatened for him to go along with any other plan.
  Once a plan is agreed upon, Huldrek will follow along with the plan. This module should directly lead into THE EXCHANGE.

  - Huldrek comes into town to try and gather up the treasure taken, the ransom note is delivered, and a plan is formed

running_notes: |
  Huldrek should be understandably panicked and worried about himself when he first gets into town. When the box comes with his grandmother's finger, he should ramp up his panic and start to plead and beg for help. 
  Huldrek honestly has no idea that he is in a terror gang. He is adamant all he does is watch a box and deliver packages.
  The courier should come into town asking for Huldrek Silverlode, that state that he has a delivery for him. The courier is a paid courier for the city. Once Huldrek is found, the courier should giver him the package and walk away. If caught or questioned, the courier should try to convince the PCs to let them leave. They know nothing except that the package was dropped off with payment by a man. He was human, average height, slender, with dark hair. He dropped off the box and left, with instructions to bring it into town and give it to Huldrek Silverlode. He was told Huldrek was in the town currently, and could find him here. He didn't ask any questions of the man. Nothing else is known by the courier.
  THIS IS A TIMED MOD. Mod failure occurs one hour after Huldrek gets the note.

Emergency Help Wanted
- This plot only runs if the treasure is found and taken. Why go to all this trouble for just a possibility of running it. Consider redesigning the plot so this is guaranteed to run.
- In the synopsis, what is meant by "useless" treasure? Is there an assumption that the players will keep all the gold, components, gases, potions etc and only return the useless items? Specifically, is the ransom note demanding 75 gold in addition to everything that was in the treasure box? This should be clear.
- Strongly suggest a player be held for ransom along with Granny to give the players enough incentive to return the treasure if you are expecting them to return 75 gold.
