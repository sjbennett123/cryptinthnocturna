description: Huldrek, the grandson of Granny Silverlode has turns up at the tavern being a rude, loud, and obnoxious drunk. Huldrek is not allowed in the tavern. 

synopsis: > 
  Huldrek, unable to take sobriety any longer, has abandoned his post guarding the Chest of the in the woods. He turns up in the tavern, unarmed, being a loud and disorderly drunk. He isn't mean or threatening, he is just looking for a few drinking buddies and a card game. Every so often, Huldrek drops hints as to his identity. Eventually, he will either: get recognized from the “Help Wanted” ad OR escalate his bragging, boasting, and thinly veiled insults to the point were he has to bribe his way out of being beaten. He will offer the map in his pocket to the PCs for allowing him to go home to his Granny.
  If he is beaten down and searched, the map to the Tarrasch Chest found in his pocket. He will either wake up and run or resurrect and return to his grandmother. 
  If Huldrek is stunned, webbed, or otherwise captured and NOT SEARCHED and returned to his Granny, Granny will insist on Huldrek “emptying out his pockets because you can't be trusted with coin!”, finds whatever coin is left, and will give the PCs the map to the Tarrasch Chest and make up the difference in the reward, if there is one.
  
outcomes: 
  - Huldrek is recognized from the HELP WANTED module, and is captured or convinced to go back to his Granny. Granny gives the map to the PCs upon collection of the reward.
  - Huldrek becomes unbearable and is threatened. Instead of a fight, Huldrek gives up the map to the Tarrasch Chest in exchange for allowing him leave to go back to his Granny.
  - Huldrek is beaten down and is searched. The map to the Tarrasch Chest is found in his pocket and/ or is left behind when he resurrects.
  - If Huldrek returns to his Granny unaccompanied by PCs and the PC's don't have the map before collection of the reward, Granny will give the PCs the map and the reward stating, eg. “He doesn't need directions to wherever this leads because he wasn't leaving the house for a month!”
