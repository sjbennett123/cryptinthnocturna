title: You Found Huldrek
Layout: module

author: Brittney Perry

schedule: Saturday
plotline: Family Recipes
requirements: The module "Operation Find Huldrek" was not ran. 

description: Huldrek, the grandson of Granny Silverlode has turns up at the tavern being a rude, loud, and obnoxious drunk. Huldrek is not allowed in the tavern. 

synopsis: > 
  Huldrek, unable to take sobriety any longer, has abandoned his post guarding the Chest of the in the woods. He turns up in the tavern, unarmed, being a loud and disorderly drunk. He isn't mean or threatening, he is just looking for a few drinking buddies and a card game. Every so often, Huldrek drops hints as to his identity. Eventually, he will either: get recognized from the “Help Wanted” ad OR escalate his bragging, boasting, and thinly veiled insults to the point were he has to bribe his way out of being beaten. He will offer the map in his pocket to the PCs for allowing him to go home to his Granny.
  If he is beaten down and searched, the map is found in his pocket. He will either wake up and run or resurrect and return to his grandmother. 
  If Huldrek is stunned, webbed, or otherwise captured and NOT SEARCHED and returned to his Granny, Granny will insist on Huldrek “emptying out his pockets because you can't be trusted with coin!”, finds whatever coin is left, and will give the PCs the map and make up the difference in the reward, if there is one.
  
outcomes: 
  - Huldrek is recognized from the HELP WANTED module, and is captured or convinced to go back to his Granny. Granny gives the map to the PCs upon collection of the reward.
  - Huldrek becomes unbearable and is threatened. Instead of a fight, Huldrek gives up the map in exchange for allowing him leave to go back to his Granny.
  - Huldrek is beaten down and is searched. The map is found in his pocket and/ or is left behind when he resurrects.

running_notes: |
  1. The Map MUST make it into PC hands if the cache is not found in OPERATION: FIND HULDREK
  2. If Huldrek returns to his Granny unaccompanied by PCs and the PC's don't have the map before collection of the reward, Granny will give the PCs the map and the reward stating, eg. “He doesn't need directions to wherever this leads because he wasn't leaving the house for a month!”
  3. Huldrek physically goes to the Chest of the Tarrasch at NOON Saturday, remove the ENCOUNTER CARD from the chest, and walk into town from there.
  4. Huldrek will stumble into the tavern around Noon, already visibly drunk and looking for a card or tavern game. He will want to gamble and has 10 silver to do so. He will continue to drink and get drunker as time goes on:
  15 minutes after entering tavern: Quarter bottle drank [having trouble standing, slurring words, being slightly rude but still apologetic]
  30 minutes: Half bottle down [same as above but starting to get unbearably rude and disruptive, no apologies anymore, brain/ mouth filter almost gone]
  45 minutes: ¾ bottle down [can't stand, having trouble walking, being very loud, insulting, no filter, will try to cheat at games]
  1 hour: Whole Bottle drank [being very loud and insulting, zero filter and brash, can't stand or walk, threatening until being threatened back, then turn cowardly]
  5. If Huldrek goads the PCs into fighting, he immediately turns cowardly and try to get away. He bribes the PCs with a map to “gold, silver, and much more! Trust me, it's worth it!” He is insistent that they trade letting him go for the map. He apologizes and backpedals hard, even begging if threatened.
  6. Hints Huldrek can drop examples-"I haven't been home since last Friday" "I didn't leave the house at all during the occupation." "My roommate is a real pain." "No, I don't live alone. But I don't want to talk about it." "I have an important job as a guard. Sometimes I can't leave my post for days! What I guard is a secrete." "No, I don't have a drinking problem." "Can I borrow a few coin?"
