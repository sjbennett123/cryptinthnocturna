Once you enter the campsite's main road, its about 1/2 a mile until you reach the main camp area. You will pass a swimming pool on the left, then come up a slight grade and enter the main camp area. Cabins are on the left. The main road continues and dead ends into a parking area. A large dining hall on your left as you approach the parking area is the tavern and module building. Check in also takes place in this building. 

Anything on the hill to the right will not be used at this event.

**Beds**: Pretty legit, fairly thick and comfy.  Just bring a blanket and pillow.

**Heat**: The stone cabins are very well heated with a huge heat blower in them. 

**Showers**: Each cabin has 2 showers.

**Bathrooms**: Each cabin has it's own bathroom.

**Assigned Cabins**: The game will assign you a cabin before the event or at checkin. 

**Reserving Cabins:** To reserve a cabin, one of two things must be met. 

- 8 paying customers ($480.00 in attendance fees) in the cabin for the 8 beds. 
- Additional payment to make up the difference between the paying customers and the ($480.00) price tag for the cabin. 

**Smoking**:  put cigarette butts in trays cans.

**Camp Boundaries**: The main area you saw was in and a few paths you saw odd were in.
