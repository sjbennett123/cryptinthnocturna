**NERO Polar Opening Ceremonies October 21, 2022**

Hello, and Welcome to the 76th Annual Hunger Games… just kidding. Welcome to the first in what we hope are many POLAR LARP events in the Pittsburgh area. I am Stephen Dupree the “Event Director” for this first event, I want to thank the rest of the board: John Thompson, Kimberly Underwood, Donnie Leight, and Keira Phillips. 

**4 Core Conduct Rules**

1. **Hold**: When there is a Hold head down, eyes closed. We do not require players to go down on one knee. Everyone that hears the Hold call needs to loudly repeat the call so that it is easily heard by any bystanders. The Lay On call need to be repeated by the players in the same way.
2. **Sneaking**: Any rogueing (robbing) of cabins requires that a Marshal to be present. Any items out in the open are fair game. Out of Game items need to be placed completely under your bed. If there is not room under the bed, the container with the Out of Game items must be clearly marked with ‘OOG’ to designate it as being Out of Game. Remember when stealing game items you have to take the prop and not the just the Item Tag. Items that belong to a different character or are Local Chapter Only to another chapter must be kept in a car for the duration of the event. All Out of Game merchant wares are **NOT** In Game and if you steal them it’s illegal in real life.
3. **Body Contact:** Nothing you wouldn’t want your grandmother to see. No sharing of beds or ‘Physical Role-Play’.
4. **No Drugs and Alcohol:** No illegal drugs or alcohol are allowed on site. If you are under 21 smoking is also against the rules. If you are taking prescription drugs, make sure to inform both the Marshals and the Medics.

**Medic:** When someone is hurt, first call a Hold, then call for a Medic. If you have any medical issues, be sure to inform the Medics for the event are **John Thompson and Kat Burns.**

**Marshals:** If there any rules issues please contact a Marshal. Marshals for the event are Ken Courtney, Donnie Leight, Mike Mack ,and Erin Albert Jamison.

**Skill Sheets**: Mark your skills off on a skill sheet between encounters.

**Auto-maxout**: NERO POLAR is an Auto-maxout chapter.

**White Headband (Out of Game):** You are In Game unless you are wearing a white headband. NPC's can go Out of Game by placing a hand or weapon on top of their head to go out of game quickly but will be using white headbands if they are Out of Game for an extended period of time.

**Orange Headband (Page Status):** Some players at the event cannot enter combat and are playing as a Page. A player playing as a Page should never be struck with a boffer weapon or a packet. In order to attack a Page, point a weapon or packet at the Page and state either “***I kill you, Page\*!**”**(**Death), or “***I down you, Page\***” (Bleeding Out). A player within 5 feet of the Page, may choose to defend the Page and block the attack. To do so, the player must state “***I defend you\***” and role-play accordingly. A person cannot defend a Page if they do not have a weapon, shield, or other ability to do so*. Encounters that are non-combat will have an orange sash on the module hook and any Adventure Cards that are non-combat will be clearly marked.*

**Wards**: All Wards must have Marshal Notes affixed to the door.

**Transforms:**. POLAR does not have an active Transform packet.  *Do not ask if your Transform goes up for an encounter.* 

**Craftsman <Type>:** The skill Craftsman <Type> explicitly records your character's mundane occupation, outside of adventuring. Characters with these skills may be provided with additional information by the Running Staff. During check in record which Craftsman <Type> skills your character has on the sign in form. *Do not ask the Running Staff if your character knows additional information based on your Craftsman <Type> skill. The Running Staff will tell you if it is applicable and what additional information your character knows.

**Non-Standard Effects:** If there are Non-Standard Effects on a module or encounter the Running Staff will ask you if you are accept the Non-Standard Effects. If you do not accept the effects you will have the opportunity to leave the encounter or in some situations another effect may be substituted.

**Rules Issues from the Last Event:**

**Cars**: Lock your car and, if possible, park it out of sight.

**Camp Boundaries:** We will announce these when this speech is given

**Smoking Areas**: Smoke in the Pavilion and put the cigarette butts away.

**Game End**: Game will be ending at 3:00 am. Adventure Cards, and Town Encounters may still be ran if there are NPC’s awake. Plot starts at 9:00 am.

**Clean Up:** We require that everyone clean up an area of the camp before leaving. See a Marshal to be assigned a clean up responsibility.

**Offsite**: All players need to be offsite by 10:00 AM. Sunday Morning.

**Leaving Early:** If leaving early make sure to do clean up and checkout. Also if you are considering it let plot know ahead of time so that we can plan.
