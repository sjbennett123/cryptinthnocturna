After the trial run of reserving cabins at the last POLAR event, we have decided to keep the policy for the winter camp at Sequanota. There will be one change, however. In order to reserve a cabin, one of two things must be met. Either 8 paying customers ($480.00) must be in the cabin, or the option for the payment to make up the difference between the paying customers and the ($480.00) price tag. POLAR thinks this gives the option to still reserve the cabins and make the payment on the cabin. If anyone would like to reserve a cabin, please contact me directly and I will set it up.
