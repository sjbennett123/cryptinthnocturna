POLAR is a non-profit organization which runs live action role-playing events on weekends nearly every month. We use the New England Roleplaying Organization® tm (NERO International) rules system. Our first concern is having fun in a safe immersive environment,  so if this sounds interesting please come to one of our events and give us a try.
