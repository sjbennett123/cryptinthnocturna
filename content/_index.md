**Take Care of Yourselves:** The most important thing is your health. 

- Stretch: Yes it looks lame. Yes you should still do it. 
- Drink Water and Eat: You are probably not used to this level of activity. 
- Pace Yourself: A weekend is a long time.

**We are the face of the event. We hold ourselves to a higher standard.** 

- Be respectful to both the players and to the other cast members.
- Don't enable or condone bad behavior. If you see something say something. 
- Focus on the small stuff. Make the small roles sing. Make the ordinary sets special. 
- Be dramatic when playing your roles. Don't phone your performance.

**Tour of NPC Shack**: Everyone is going to need to know the organization of the NPC Shack and help keep it organized. This organization is a work in progress and after the event we should discuss any improvement ideas you have. The stuff here was donated please be considerate and help make it last.

- **Costumes**: When you are done make sure the costume is put away.
- **Belts**: When you are using a tabard wear a belt.
- **Masks**: When you are done using a mask wipe it down so it does not get anyone sick.
- **Packets**: After fights don't mix wet packets back in with the fresh packets. it will cause them to decompose. 

**Secrecy**: You will learn things while running that are intended to be secret from the players. It will also need to be firewalled in your brain from the knowledge you have when you PC. Sometimes you will need to "Play Dumb" when you PC. . 

**Overview of writeups**: This event may be different than many of you are used to, we have a lot more structure and writing than you have probably seen in the past. This might seem stifling, but we hope that we can convince you that can make for great experience for both you and the players.
