## The History of the Bloody Fist

# Introduciton

The driving goal for the Bloody Fist is Vengeance for the extinction they almost faced 20 some years ago.

Surrender is NOT an option for the Bloody Fist. If they are to die it will be in battle glory. They will implore whatever savage tactics to win they see fit. If they are commanded to capture all women and children from a village until the men submit then they will. Public executions and necromantic humiliation are very common.

They CAN be settled with on terms but they would be very one sided and demand 20 years of suffering for Stonewood if they were to accept. Plus the deaths of all nobility responsible in the previous war.

They are not above capturing PCs and taking prisoners. Some Bloody Fist NPCs will be given specific targets to capture certain PCs or NPCs in town they players can defend. Most captured NPCs are killed brutally unless it is a plot hook. PCs will be “held in a prison” until they are able to be rescued or the player choose to persue the Bloody Fist and raid a camp with a follow up module but these are NOT easy to assault a Bloody Fist encampment. The camps normally have casters and soldiers on standby awaiting a returning Raiding party. The Earth Casters of the Bloody Fist love to raise the dead of the PCs and important NPCs as Undead and send them into town to attack for the sheer horror, a cruel payback tactic of the humiliation they face in the last war

Think about how you feel with a a constant ache that never goes away. A headache, a backache a toothache. that shortness of temper and lack of patience. That is what being an orc is like.
You just can't think and it makes you furious that others can. Always have a chip on your sholder.

 \- Scowl
 \- cut people off when they are talking
 \- Revel in making people uncomfortable

Speaking as an orc - Gruff

Because of that fury and lack of restraint the resentment that others have is often well founded but it is still resentment.  

\---

Before every meal the orcs will give an offering to thier fallen brothers by pouring one out at the banner of the fist.
The banner of the fist is consecrated with the blood of the orcs that bear it into battle

\--
orc stories around the campfire
orc songs - like rugby songs
the orcs that we see have been conscripted they have family back home they will talk about them.

Gossip about the generals. Opinions and hte like
Gossip about other missions.
furstration with poor leadership that quickly gets squashed. (maybe have an incompetent general)
stories of success and plunder.
orc traitors

# Background

##   The great Orc War and Defeat

The Bloody Fist tribe waged a bloody war 20 some years ago against Stonewood and the heroes of Elysia. The war was very long and bloody, but in the end the Blood Fist was defeated. 

The heroes of Elysia killed their Warlord and put the remainder of the bloody fist to death on a witch hunt level of extermination. The surviving Bloody Fist ran into the darkened Forests and hills of Eastern Stonewood. In exile they tried to adopt a new way of life but all they knew was war and raiding so this was a doomed venture.

Over these 20 years, the burning memory of defeat and exile chewed away at the surviving Bloody Fist Tribe sanity and will to live. 

##   A dark Bargain with the black shadow

A few moons ago, a Shadowy Elf in Black Robes descended from the night sky before a very young orc named Ahourn Hope-Flayer. Ahourn rose to meet this man with cold steel but the Elf waved his hand and imprisoned him. The shadowy figure spoke to him “If you give me your Tribe’s blood oath and fealty, I shall empower you with righteous vengeance that will shake the very existence of Elysia. Ahourn was but a young orc in the Great War 20 years ago but he remembered holding his dying father and brother who were cut down by Nobility of Stonewood. With burning hatred in his eyes, he accepted the offer of the robed man. Ahroun was freed but went through a terrifying transformation. Screaming till his eyes and mouth bled, he looked to the moon then down at a pool of water and saw he had Draconic features now and felt the presence of Celestial Magic in his blood.

- The new Uruk-Hai Bloody Fist Orcs are faster, stronger, smarter, more savage, more tactical, and more organized than the traditional Orcs of NERO and Bloody Fist of the last war
- Uruk-Hai Casters now travel in pairs, always with a Celestial Caster and an Earth Caster in each squadron that is assigned casters.

## The Banner of the Bloody Fist

![banner_of_the_fist.jpg](/banner_of_the_fist.jpg)

When they enter the battlefield, they carry a banner of the Blood Fist and plant it before rushing into battle. If they fight within 10 ft of the Banner they receive the Blessing of the Bloody Fist. The Blessing is as follows:

**Blessing of the Bloody Fist**: All Bloody Fist Urak-hai within 10 ft of the Standard swing an additional 5 damage on weapons, they can regenerate 20 Body on a 5 Count of “I drink your blood... X” and finally they may rip from binding as per Rip From Binding Strong trait an unlimited number of times within 10 ft of the Banner.

The banner can be destroyed on a 15 count of Un-Interrupted Role-Play of “I destroy the Banner 1.....” 

The Bloody Fist defend the Banner fiercely and not be drawn away easily unless provoked. Tactically they stay near the banner and their Casters but can be provoked with rage or killing blows of their fallen brothers in arms to break ranks sometimes.
