These notes have been collected at great personal cost by the reformed Black Anvil Company. Due to the nature of the Bloody Fist we can only guess at some of the deeper secrets that they hold but the information contained within is accurate to the best of our knowledge.


# Motivations

While it is easy to think that the bloody fist are only motivated by their brutal nature that is far from the truth. Their driving goal is Vengeance for the extinction they nearly faced 20 years ago. From the ashes of defeat their whole society has been formed around resentment and hate. The time to resolve this emnity was while the hatred simmered but now it has become a rolling boil. We have found that surrender is not an option for the Bloody Fist. If they are to die it will be in battle glory. 

We have seen that they employ whatever savage tactics to win they see fit. If they are commanded to capture all women and children from a village until the men submit then they will. Public executions and necromantic humiliation are very common.

We believe that they can be settled with on terms but they would be very one sided and demand 20 years of suffering for Stonewood if they were to accept. Plus the deaths of all nobility responsible in the previous war.

# A Dark Bargain with the Black Shadow

This tale has been repeated around the campfires of the Bloody Fist. A legend of thier rebirth as a new horde. 

*A few moons ago, a Shadowy Elf in Black Robes descended from the night sky before a very young orc named Ahourn. Ahourn rose to meet this man with cold steel but the Elf waved his hand and imprisoned him. The shadowy figure spoke to him “If you give me your Tribe’s blood oath and fealty, I shall empower you with righteous vengeance that will shake the very existence of Elysia. Ahourn was but a young orc in the Great War 20 years ago but he remembered holding his dying father and brother who were cut down by Nobility of Stonewood. With burning hatred in his eyes, he accepted the offer of the robed man. Ahroun was freed but went through a terrifying transformation. Screaming till his eyes and mouth bled, he looked to the moon then down at a pool of water and saw he had Draconic features now and felt the presence of Celestial Magic in his blood.*

# Dragon Orcs

The new Uruk-Hai Bloody Fist Orcs are faster, stronger, smarter, more savage, more tactical, and more organized than traditional Orcs and Bloody Fist of the last war. They are made this way by the ritual that was gifted by the black shadow the process causes a tremendous amount of pain often killing the changing orc. Even if the orc survives it comes at a tremendous cost. The pain never really stops.  Think about how you feel with a a constant ache that never goes away. A headache, a backache a toothache. that shortness of temper and lack of patience. That is what being an orc is like. They just can't think and it makes them furious that others can. Often the behavior that we see from these orcs is visible as a short temper. These are some of the things that we have seen

 - Scowl
 - Gruff Speech
 - cut people off when they are talking
 - Revel in making people uncomfortable
 - Roar when entering into battle

The orcs that we see have been conscripted they have family back home they will talk about them.

# The History of the Bloody Fist

## The Great Orc War and Defeat

The Bloody Fist tribe waged a bloody war 20 some years ago against Stonewood and the heroes of Elysia. The war was very long and bloody, but in the end the Blood Fist was defeated.

The heroes of Elysia killed their Warlord and put the remainder of the bloody fist to death on a witch hunt level of extermination. The surviving Bloody Fist ran into the darkened Forests and hills of Eastern Stonewood. In exile they tried to adopt a new way of life but all they knew was war and raiding so this was a doomed venture.

Over these 20 years, the burning memory of defeat and exile chewed away at the surviving Bloody Fist Tribe sanity and will to live.

## The Taking of Stonewood

### The Accords of the Fist

The Accords of the Fist were agreed to by the townspeople as part of he parlay with the brutal Bloody Fist Orcs. There was some initial resistance but now it’s just how you live your life. When you see anyone that is not following the rules you will be concerned that the Orcs will see that the agreement is not being kept to. You have been safe after the initial purge but, those that did not obey the laws that the Bloody Fist put down have not been so lucky. 

- No weapons on person or drawn
- No spells in hand
- No verbal condemnation  of Orcish Might
- Kneel or bow at the Bloody Fist Banners

### The Pledge of Servitude

Every day at 10PM the town of Stonewood gathers to pledge allegiance to the bloody fist and to offer up their tithe. 

The Accords of the Fist mandate that the town give an offering every day. This is led by the mayor but if he is away of in infirm health another member of the citizenry will perform this ceremony. Each of the townspeople that are able will join around a banner of the bloody fist and recite the Pledge of Servitude. 

*The mighty Bloody Fist is benevolent.*

*The mighty Bloody Fist is kind.*

*The mighty Bloody Fist is gentle.*

*We accept our place below the mighty orc.* **{bow}**

## The Banner of the Fist

The banner of the fist is consecrated with the blood of the orcs that bear it into battle. When a great victory is had the most powerful warriors are sacrificed by the shamans and their spirits are imbued in the banners. This is not a punishment of any sort it is a great reward to be with their brothers offering strength forevermore.  Before every meal the orcs give an offering to thier fallen brothers by pouring one out at the banner of the fist.

When the Bloody Fist enters battle, the banner of the Blood Fist is planted in the ground. By channeling the trapped spirit within the banner the warriors within 10 Feet of the banner can receive **The Blessing of he Bloody Fist**. The Bloody Fist are known to defend the Banner fiercely and not be drawn away unless provoked. Tactically they stay near the banner and their Casters but can be provoked with rage or killing blows of their fallen brothers in arms to break ranks sometimes. The banner can be destroyed on a 15 count Counted Action of “I destroy the Banner 1.....”.

**Blessing of the Bloody Fist**: All Bloody Fist Urak-hai within 10 Feet of the Banner.

## Other Notables

### Bonesaw the Jailor

Known for his brutal ways of blood sacrifice. Some don’t care for for his approach but his favor with Ahon means he cannot be challenged. The warlord favors his methods because they bring results.

#### The Final Comfort

Captives of the Bloody Fist are offered a choice to die or accept the caress of the fist. They should have chosen death. The poor souls that have chosen are then bound and a deadly magic is inflicted upon them. This magic creates terrible creatures from their pain. The creatures are bound to the area nearby the poor captive but are fearsome foes. The Bloody fist get a particular glee from the suffering that this causes.

### Orcamedies

The spirt of the great orcish inventor that plagued Greyhorn captured in a talking skull. He attempted to join the Bloody Fist but rather than take him in the bloody fist took the only part they needed of him his intellect and flayed the flesh from his bones. Now he provides technical assistance but plots his death and an end to this half life. 

#### Ballista

A powerful Ballista made of stonewood that can fire specially made bolts that can penetrate even the most powerful strucutre. 

#### Spirit Bomb

A powerful weapon that has been developed in secret it feeds off the marinated spirits of 6 powerful orc warriors who are allowing themselves to be transferred to a fearsome contraption that will force the will of those orcs upon all those who are within 30 miles of the detonation. The infusion of orcish energy will sway the minds of those who are affected to be sympathetic to the orcish cause. 

#### The Gnawing Ones

During the occupation of the town of Stonewood the Bloody Fist introduced  an invasive woodborne pest that fed on the roots of the mighty stonewood trees.  Sated they would move to a breeding stage digging large caverns for their young to live as they grow.

## Scouting tips

They are not above capturing PCs and taking prisoners. Some Bloody Fist NPCs will be given specific targets to capture certain PCs or NPCs in town they players can defend. Most captured NPCs are killed brutally unless it is a plot hook. PCs will be “held in a prison” until they are able to be rescued or the player choose to persue the Bloody Fist and raid a camp with a follow up module but these are NOT easy to assault a Bloody Fist encampment. The camps normally have casters and soldiers on standby awaiting a returning Raiding party. The Earth Casters of the Bloody Fist love to raise the dead of the PCs and important NPCs as Undead and send them into town to attack for the sheer horror, a cruel payback tactic of the humiliation they face in the last war
