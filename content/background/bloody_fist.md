Bloody Fist Orc Plotline:

·    The Bloody Fist tribe waged a bloody war 20some years ago against Stonewood and the heroes of Elysia. The war was very long and blood, but in the end the Blood Fist was defeated. 

·    The heroes of Elysia killed their Warlord and put them to death on witch hunt level of extermination. The surviving Bloody Fist ran into the darkened Forests and hills of Eastern Stonewood. In exile they tried to adopt a new way of life but all they knew was war and raiding so this was a doomed venture.

·    Over these 20 years, the burning memory of defeat and exile chewed away at the surviving Bloody Fist Tribe sanity and will to live. A few moons ago, a Shadowy Elf in Black Robes descended from the night sky before a very young orc named Ahourn Hope-Flayer. Ahourn rose to meet this man with cold steel but the Elf waved his hand and imprisoned him. The shadowy figure spoke to him “If you give me your Tribe’s blood oath and fealty, I shall empower you with righteous vengeance that will shake the very existence of Elysia. Ahourn was but a young orc in the Great War 20 years ago but he remembered holding his dying father and brother who were cut down by Nobility of Stonewood. With burning hatred in his eyes, he accepted the offer of the robed man. Ahroun was freed but went through a terrifying transformation. Screaming till his eyes and mouth bled, he looked to the moon then down at a pool of water and saw he had Draconic features now and felt the presence of Celestial Magic in his blood.

o  Bloody Fist never really used Celestial Magic as they considered it dirty sky magic.

o  With the infusion of Rygalius’s Dragonflame magic, the Bloody Fist become a Draconic Uruk-Hai like orc over the default Orc in NERO. NO ONE KNOWS the source of their power or the name Rygaulis except for Ahroun the Butcher but speaking his name would automatically kill him. Ahourn makes sacrifices to Rygalius in secret to show his allegiance

o  The new Uruk-Hai Bloody Fist Orcs are faster, stronger, smarter, more savage, more tactical, and more organized than the traditional Orcs of NERO and Bloody Fist of the last war

o  Uruk-Hai Casters now travel in pairs, always with a Celestial Caster and an Earth Caster in each squadron that is assigned casters.

o  The Ranks of the Bloody Fist are as follows: Warlord > Generals > Honor Guard > High Shamans > Raid Leaders > Bloody Fist Grunt

·    Current Structure:

o  Warlord: Ahroun the Hope-Flayer

o  Generals: Grimfang Skyrender, Val’Kaz the Ruthless, Mal-Valoance the Devourer

o  Honor Guard: Nameless Soldiers, They all give up their names to serve the Bloody Fist. High Shaman and Up are escorted around by them

o  High Shamans: Strum Skyburner (Celestial Avatar of the Sky), Nur’gal Bloodbane (Earth Necromancer), Uktena Wolvesbane (Earth Spirit Healer)

o  Raid Leaders: Gnar the Black Fury, Skindancer the Cruel, Wendigo the White Howler

o  Bloody Fist Grunts: Standard Orc names but more draconic and evil sounding. Most don’t care what they are called since they are bred for war and only know war much like Urak-Hai

·    The driving goal for the Bloody Fist is Vengence for the extinction they almost faced 20some years ago.

·    Surrender is NOT an option for the Bloody Fist. If they are to die it will be in battle glory. They will implore whatever savage tactics to win they see fit. If they are commanded to capture all women and children from a village until the men submit then they will. Public executions and necromantic humiliation are very common.

·    They CAN be settled with on terms but they would be very one sided and demand 20 years of suffering for Stonewood if they were to accept. Plus the deaths of all nobility responsible in the previous war.

·    When they enter the playing field, they should carry a banner of the Blood Fist and plant it before rushing into battle. If they fight within 10 ft of the Banner they receive the Blessing of the Bloody Fist. The Blessing is as follows:

o  Blessing of the Bloody Fist: All Bloody Fist Urak-hai within 10 ft of the Standard swing an additional 5 damage on weapons, they can regenerate 20 Body on a 5 Count of “I drink your blood... X” and finally they may rip from binding as per Rip From Binding Strong trait an unlimited number of times within 10 ft of the Banner.

§ The banner can be destroyed on a 15 count of Un-Interrupted Role-Play of “I destroy the Banner 1.....” 

§ The Bloody Fist will defend the Banner fiercely and not be drawn away easily unless provoked. Tactically they stay near the banner and their Casters but can be provoked with rage or killing blows of their fallen brothers in arms to break ranks sometimes.

·    They are not above capturing PCs and taking prisoners. Some Bloody Fist NPCs will be given specific targets to capture certain PCs or NPCs in town they players can defend. Most captured NPCs are killed brutally unless it is a plot hook. PCs will be “held in a prison” until they are able to be rescued or the player choose to persue the Bloody Fist and raid a camp with a follow up module but these are NOT easy to assault a Bloody Fist encampment. The camps normally have casters and soldiers on standby awaiting a returning Raiding party. The Earth Casters of the Bloody Fist love to raise the dead of the PCs and important NPCs as Undead and send them into town to attack for the sheer horror, a cruel payback tactic of the humiliation they face in the last war
