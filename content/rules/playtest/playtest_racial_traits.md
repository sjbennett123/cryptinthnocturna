**version**:  1.2

**Objective**:  This playtest expands racial abilities and opens them up to purchase and use for all races at an increased cost. The primary purpose of this is to facilitate a broader range of character concepts and role-play otions to all NERO players

**Secondary Objective**: Secondary benefits of this playtest are the elimination of racial restrictions and disadvantage. This also serves to expand the viable options for players and characters in the future. 

**Summary**:  The Races of Tyrra each ossess natural tendencies and attributes, in NEOR these are represented by traits, the traits a character has determine the skills that are easier to learn for that character. Each race also receives a featured skill, most often a weapon that comes naturally to that race. The traits and features that are associated with each race are found on table 2. Table 1 lists all available racial skills, as well as two costs. One lower cost for races that have the same trait as the category of the skill, and another higher cost, for characters without hte trait. Characters may oly purchase one racial skill per level, and oly skills who lowest cost is 4 build points or less can be purchased multiple times.

**Note**: This playtests removes all restrictions and benefits related to race listed in the Nero 9'th edition rulebook. Body point changes, build discounts, and skill purchase requirements; they are all considered removed when using this playtest.
