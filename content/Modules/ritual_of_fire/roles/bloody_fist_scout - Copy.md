The Lumber Job: Bloody Fist Scout:

*You are part of an elite fighting machine and the strongest Orc tribe in Elysia to date. Just because you are so young, and a mere scout doesn’t mean you aren’t important to the Bloody Fist. Without the Scouts the Bloody Fist would be steps behind their enemies not ahead.*

The NPCs will rest 2 times upon death and come from other parts of the Lumbermill to defend. The NPCs may appear behind the players and start from outside the mod shack where they players entered to simulate being surrounded.
