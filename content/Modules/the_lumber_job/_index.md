 **Brief**: The Bloody Fist are loading up the carts with Stonewood cut Lumber to take back to their masters. They started demanding this after they tortured enough of the Cutters guild and found its true properties. Whispers of Ballista’s made from Stonewood


 **Requirements:** 

- Saturday Afternoon

- Forged by Broken Hands module has been run


**Synopsis**: The PCs are given a list of buildings to reclaim if Stonewood is to be theirs again. The Bloody Fist are setting up the next big shipment of Stonewood Lumber to their masters. They are talking about a ballista they are going to make and test on Stonewood soon with this

**Outcomes**: 

(1) The Lumber Mill is cleared out, the carts of Stonewood are stopped and the Bloody Fist are unable to complete their Stonewood Ballista.

(2) The carts of Stonewood Lumber depart and arrive to their masters camps, construction on a Stonewood Ballista is started (Would be completed by next event in Stonewood)

**Rumors**:

I have heard talk of a new weapon they are trying to create to make this war even easier for them. Something about “Only Stonewood Lumber can build the strength of projectile we need” I haven’t seen any prototypes yet the weapon itself. But it does not sound good for any of us if they build it

 **Running Notes**:  The Lumbermill of Stonewood is where the Stonewood trees are ritually harvested and turned into fine Lumber to build with or trade. The Bloody Fist will defend this place very fiercely. The NPCs will rest 2 times upon death and come from other parts of the Lumbermill to defend. The NPCs may appear behind the players and start from outside the mod shack where they players entered to simulate being surrounded. This module is designed for lower to mid seasoned adventurers 

~**1 Hour after this module has been completed, the Cutters guild will bring into town a new Stonewood sign to replace the destroyed one at the towns entrance as a symbol of hope to the people~**
