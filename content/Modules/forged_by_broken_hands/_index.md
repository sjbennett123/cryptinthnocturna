 **Requirements:** 

·    Saturday Afternoon

·    To Ward off Famine Module has been run

**Synopsis**: The PCs are given a list of buildings to reclaim if Stonewood is to be theirs again. The Bloody Fist are researching Stonewood Dwarf craft and metallurgy. If left unchecked this will give Bloody Fist access to Dwarves craft. 

**Outcomes**: 

(1) The Forge is cleared out and recovered. No Bloody Fist can take these Dwarven secrets back to their masters. The Forges are relit in Stonewood. 

(2) The Forges in Stonewood are sabotaged by the Bloody Fist and the secret of Stonewood metallurgy has fallen into the hands of the Oppressors.

**Rumors**:

It seems to me that these creatures have taken an interest in Dwarven smiting. I can’t tell if they are looking for Ore or weaponry. But it appears the creatures want to find something in the forge that the Dwarves have been hiding.
