**Written by:** Chris Colland

**Reviewed by:** Scott Bennett




 **Brief**: The Granary of Stonewood has been besieged by Bloody Fist scouts! They don’t seem terribly interested in the Grain but something else is happening in that building besides just eating….




 **Requirements:** 

·    Saturday Afternoon

·    Bloody Fist have come to town in the morning

·    The Curse of El ’Dorado breakfast module has happened

 

**Synopsis**: The PCs are given a list of buildings to reclaim if Stonewood is to be theirs again. The Granary wont feed Bloody Fist Uruks but it will make for a good place to poison the townfolk from

 

**Outcomes**: 

(1) The Granary is cleared out of Bloody Fist Scouts and the poisoned food is not released to the Town of Stonewood. The poison is not particularly lethal but is rather an addictive substance that would make it hard to stop eating Grain until there is none left.

(2) The grain reserves of the town of Stonewood are poisoned, the populace they will starve themselves this winter. This is detailed in the section “Binge and Purge” 

**Rumors**:

“The monsters have been seen around the Granary at night. They don’t take anything with them when they leave but I have not a clue what they are doing. Could be hiding something or just hungry. Very weird behaviors for what I assume to be an Orc of some type.”

 **Running Notes**: 

 

The Bloody Fist are trying to poison the grain supply in Stonewood so they will have nothing to eat by winter. The Scouts aren’t particularly invested in dying here so if things get out of hand they can all just flee if overwhelmed. If fleeing occurs, they mod will continue in the streets of Stonewood till Scouts are all killed. 

There are 2 rooms to the Granary, the first room has 4 Bloody Fist Scouts sitting around, the second room won’t be triggered till the PCs open the door. Room 2 is more of an ambush; PC will exit mod shack and “loop” around the door to the back room where they will face another 4 Bloody Fist Scouts. This module is designed for lower seasoned adventurers.
