Running Notes: The Will-O-Wisps wander around the outskirts and into town trying to gather as many people as possible to lure to Hessol Korag’s blood feast! The self-proclaimed Vampire Prince Hessol has been working on replenishing his feeding stock and with a huge disruption in town with fresh blood he plans to do just that! 
Once the Will-O-Wisps have lured enough people away by their presence or by Arcane Charming them “Follow Me” the Wisps will return to Hessol with his newly converted Ghouls to feast upon them after a fresh bite. Hessol and the 5 Ghouls will be waiting in an ambush near unused cabins down the other side of town for the new arrivals to the blood feast. The players running from this encounter and fleeing to get help is completely valid! If Hessol marks at least 3 people, he will retreat into the night and will return next event
