**Bringing Balance**

 

**Written by:** Michael Fife          **Reviewed by:** 




 **Brief**: Adair takes adventurers deep in the woods to find a large Order node. They must fight through the Lizard men guards and the elemental they summoned to bring it down.

o **Pre-requisites:** Ran after the “Forest Protector” mod

**Background:** The node that has been discovered is what is giving Mhairshulk strength within the land. Adair will tell the players that turning the node into chaos from order will start changing the land back to normal. 

**Synopsis**: Adair spoke to the adventurers earlier about the problems with one plane of existence taking over in the Prime material plane. He brings the adventurers to an Order node that seems to be larger than most and is growing stronger by the day, giving power to the Order following Lizard man army. Adair will lead them to a path towards the node, which is guarded heavily by lizard men. Fighting their way towards the node, they will be confronted by and Order elemental. Upon reaching him, he will accuse the players of being agents of chaos since they are in the presence of a chaos caster and attack them, no matter if they try to talk to him or not. After apologizing to the players, Adair will cast chaos magic into the Order node to revert it into a chaos node, after which he will tell them to expect him later in the day.

 

**Outcomes**: (1) Players will fight through and take down the Order node, helping to restore nature. (2)Players will fight the lizard guards and the Order elemental, but not allow Adair to cast the chaos magic (3) Players will be overcome by the fighting and have to flee.

Role: Adair (played by Michael Fife)



*I have been charged with watching over this part of the land for what seems like centuries. The elders have proclaimed that the balance must be kept! The lizard men seemed to have kept that until more moved in. With the erection of the obelisks, they have made Order nodes to strengthen themselves and the plane of Order. With my hands tied, I must seek assistance from the outside!*

**Description**:

·     Adair still shows off his calm demeanor during the whole module

·    He will speak with the players bluntly, but never show anger unless they deface nature (littering in his presence for example)

·    Before casting the chaos magic upon the Order node (Desecrate 2 times) He will tell them his plans, letting them know what he must do to “cleanse” the Order node.

·    If attacked, Adair will not fight back and try to calm the players down with talk. If none listen, he will flee.

·    Will only go with adventurers if they have no healer in party
