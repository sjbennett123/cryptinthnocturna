Checkers with the Magma Lord **:: Macklin the Magma Lord**



A fire elemental goes through a lifecycle it burns bright then then fades away to be replaced by the new flames that rise up. 

You are near the end of your time. There is one thing that you are willing to spend the last of your time doing and that is playing checkers. You have placed yourself in stasis and are willing to speak to the adventueres that are able to best your elementals to battle you a a true duel, a duel of wits. If they are successful they will be able to pick from the 2 treasures that you have on your table. If they fail then they will be asked to leave. They can return to try their luck again but 



**Planar Mind:** Invite the players to talk amongst themselves to make the best play against him. Expalin that you can communicate with all of the elmentals on the plane of fire.

**Levelheaded** Unlike most fire elementals you have control of your temper and are simply interested in playing your game. If someone takes the artifacts from the table without having bested you in the contest you will slaughter them and all of their people it is the way of things.

**Magma Lord : Greater Fire Elemental**



Fire elementals go through a cycle like that of any flame. They ignite, grow in intensity then cool and fade away to be replaced with new flames. 

As they near the end of their days many of the mightiest fire elementals take up the title of magma lord and enter a stasis that they only are roused from for worthy events. For some these events are battle and carnage, for others appreciation of art and theater.



**Reason for Living**: The life of a magma lord is spent waiting for a certain activity. The magma lord only removes himself from stasis to participate in this activity.
