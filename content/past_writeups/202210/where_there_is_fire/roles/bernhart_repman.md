---

**Brief:**  A chimera has been planted in a herd of sheep and has  shapeshifted into one of the sheep. It is plucking them off when hungry. 

**Background**: The brothers Repman are both shepards and assholes. They are famous for the quality of their wool but will often "Alter the Deal” when they are about to actually make the sale. Several months ago they were commissioned to make a cloak for a powerful but capricious wizard. Their normal plan of adding "fees" to the sale after the fact did not go well... at all. The wizard paid the price but planted a seed of a young chimera that he knew would terrorize the shepards but he would be long gone by the time it hatched and terrorized them.

**Synopsis:** Adventure begins as a young shepherd, Bernhart Repman, comes into town. The shepherd is looking to recruit some moderately experienced adventurers to tackle a problem that he had come across. His flock keeps disappearing slowly leaving a bloody mess in the morning where one of his sheep had been. He heard no noise like a wolf would make, so he is perplexed. He will lead the adventurers out to his fields... where his brother, Symon Repman, was watching the sheep, and he will show them a sheep that was torn apart last night. 

There are sheep milling about. When the adventurers spread out or search for the reason for the sheep’s demise, the sheep will try to be friendly to the PC’s and eventually, a Chimera will lead an adventurer off and transform to attack a weak looking adventurer. When the Chimera shows it's true form, the sheep will be terrified and try to hide by snuggling the adventurers.

**Hook:**  Bernhart Repman comes into town looking for help with his dismembered sheep.
