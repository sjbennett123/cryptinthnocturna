*You were once the protector of this town. Now in your olden age you are not the Dwarf you once were. Before you would have died before these filthy Bloody Fist scum plagued your walls. But your life has been hard since the occupation set in and the execution of the Black Anvil Company, more importantly the grim executions of you friends.*

- Balor is a gruff old grumpy Dwarf but a very honorable one
- He has seen more battles with the monsters of Elysia than he cares to remember
- You can always get him to talk about his glory days over a nice warm pint
- He is very protective of Stonewood, this occupation is a literal living hell for him. He wants to liberate the town badly, but his spirits have been crushed this last year
- Depending how the PCs interact with him, he will start to open up about rebellion or laugh at their dreams of liberating the town of Stonewood
- No one knows the town of Stonewood better than Balor, he keeps tabs on everyone for the greater good of the town
- He won’t carry any weapons actively so he can respect the Accords of the Fist but he keeps spells hidden on himself to aid the Citizens when the Bloody Fist are brutal to them
- Balor will be used as a very common hook and rumor character to keep the players in the loop
- If the town is restored after the first event Balor’s satisfaction, he will reinstate the Black Anvil Company as the new Town Guard for Stonewood with he PCs support
