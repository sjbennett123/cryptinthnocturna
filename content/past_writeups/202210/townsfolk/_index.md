- These townsfolk are played across the course of the weekend. These encounters are meant to be played for the majority of the weekend and may be killed in dramatic fashion for plot points and modules.

- 5 important ones will be present during the opening module and opening night roleplay modules.

- A Human fortuneteller will be in town on Saturday as a active roleplay encounter to hand out plot hints and entertainment.

- The citizens of Stonewood are content but broken under occupation of the Bloody Fist.

  - They havenâ€™t been killed or executed since the beginning of the occupation. This past 6 months have been very peaceful and almost normal.
  - A group of adventurers attempted to free the Town of Stonewood 1 year ago alongside Balor Ironleaf using the alias Black Leaf but were ultimately slaughtered and occupation continued. 
  - Talk about the good times before the occupation once you are warming up with the townsfolk and seem them actually having a winning shot at this.
  - You will be very skeptical of outsiders marching in saying they will save you the first time since you watched it happen one year ago.
