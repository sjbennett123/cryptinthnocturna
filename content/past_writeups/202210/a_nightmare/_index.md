(Targeted to the one who is chosen by the Morumbrians. The youngest player that seems like they would enjoy being focus of the extra dimensional manhunt that the Morumbrians are on) 

Every night for the past few weeks you have been troubled by terrible dreams. When you wake up you are covered in sweat and cannot shake a feeling of doom.

---

The dream begins with you being held cradled like a baby by a gigantic figure in dark robes. Held close to it’s chest you cannot see it’s face. You are not comforted by this action despite the apparent kindness of the gesture. The figure's skin is cold and the it’s movement is stiff and emotionless. 

A cold purple light pervades the room glowing in intensity… then you wake up.
