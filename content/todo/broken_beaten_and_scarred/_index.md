**Brief**: The Bloody Fist have taken the Stonewood Barracks by storm! The remaining soldiers have been killed, surrendered, or fled the Barracks. The few who stood and fought now lay dead on the floor around them awaiting final death’s judgement at the gates of the Graveyard.

**Requirements**:

- Saturday Afternoon 

- A Stout for Legends module has been run


**Synopsis**: The Bloody Fist have taken and slaughtered most of the remaining Stonewood resistance soldiers. They seek to slaughter them all or enslave them to service of the Bloody Fist. If the PCs cannot stop the Bloody Fist from taking the barracks back then the attacks will become more frequent and savage with no outlying guards to alert them before the Bloody Fist reach the town, not to mention the Blood Fist stealing their weapons!

**Outcomes**:

1. The Bloody Fist are defeated and cleared from the Barracks. The remaining Stonewood soldiers who surrendered or ran survive and now they have a chance to fight back.

2. The Bloody Fist slaughter the remaining Stonewood Soldiers and raid the armory in the Barracks leaving Stonewood completely defenseless to the Bloody Fist, the attacks will increase in frequency with no resistance. This is detailed in the section “Bodies fill the fields I see”


**Rumors**:

These poor souls have been through very rough conditions. With healing supplies running low as is, the Barracks of Stonewood is waving in their resolve. The newly imposed Accords have left them hiding their movements and is making them question their honor. Something must give for these brave souls to be restored to former glory.
