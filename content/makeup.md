I'd definitely say black, white, red. Green, blue, yellow, Brown. But you don't need all of those at once I would think. Just what you'll be using that weekend.

A big part of it is there wasn't a space set aside for the makeup. This led to the makeup being in two separate spots, and having to go between them to find makeup. People would pick up something, use it,  and then set it down in the other spot. It wasted a ton of prep time.

It was hard to see what makeup was there, because there just wasn't room to set anything out. So there was time wasted trying to find things.

Grease paint is so hard to clean up and stains. I heard several minor complaints on that end. I think making the switch to water based would help our NPC moral around makeup.





I agree with keeping a kit  with better quality item in it. Plus, you can do so much with an airbrush and a few liquid colors.
