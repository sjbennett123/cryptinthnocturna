*Breakfast will not be until after 10am. Due to childcare plans, I'm driving in from an hour away in the morning. I plan to be on site by 10 at the latest. If you're an early riser and need anything, there will be fruit to get you going.*

My most crucial clean up volunteers will be at the conclusion of dinner time, so that I can get everything loaded in my car and head back to pick up my son. I think based on space, I'll need 2/3 people that know how to properly clean and dry. I know it becomes a popular cleanup request and I will be taking volunteers on a first come basis, based on who is standing in front of me when I need the help. I can't go searching for anyone on a sign up sheet.
