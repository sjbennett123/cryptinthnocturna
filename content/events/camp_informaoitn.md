Camp Site Info.
Once you enter the camp site main road, its about 1/2 a mile until you reach the cabin area. Once you pass the swimming pool on the left, you will come up a slight grade and enter the main camp area. Cabins are on the left. Main road continues and dead ends in a parking area. Large dining hall will be on your left as you approach the parking area. This will be the tavern and mod building. Check in will also take place in this building. Anything on the hill to the right will not be used at this event.



There is a Dollar General right near the entrance to camp if you forgot anything or need a last minute pickup! Just got here early and figured I would shout this out. Great for snacks and bottled water
