      <description>You aspired to be a singer in the Glavorn Playhouse since you were a small child. You were fascinated by the stage, and your family were wealthy patrons of the playhouse giving you access to many shows and actors. Your parents had you tutored in the art of singing and dance but acting is where your heart lays.
You studied with Michel Kincade at the Glavorn Playhouse for many years, and when asked, you decided to go on a traveling show that was overrun by undead necromancer Odomach one fated evening.</description>

      <description>You are a tough and capable fighter. However, this tough facade crumbles when the time allows. You are the oldest of your 3 siblings and joined the King’s Army out of a sense of honor and duty after your parents were killed by a necromancer Odomach. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”)
You are from Ebbonmar Originally, moving to Glavorn when you turned 6 years old.</description>

      <description>You were born in Glavorn and met Henri when he was 6 years old. You ran through the streets of Glavorn, and his family took in the three Kincade siblings when their parents were killed and became undead. (This is detailed in the section titled “The Great Playhouse Massacre”) Tangui and Henri joined the king’s army at the same time and have served together throughout their careers. They have fought in many engagements and are the closest of friends.</description>

      <description>Le Roi en Jaune
Thale: Then how do you know that he’s indisposed?
Well he must be indisposed if he isn’t here, don’t you think?
That’s one theory.
And your theory is what?
Perhaps he has been detained. (To Camilla.) Perhaps he’s even been arrested. Perhaps his dear sweet sister…
(Aghast.) I deny it!!
… has him arrested on the orders of his unimpeachably honest uncle.
Thale, will you stop torturing the girl?</description>

      <description>The Journey to El’Dorado: The Great Playhouse Massacre
The day of the massacre began as any other. It was the start of fall and the cold air was just starting to be the norm rather than the exception. The travelling troupe had canvassed the area the day before and the crowd was excited for the show. As the audience settled in and began to read their playbills you could hear a low groan coming from across the field.</description>
