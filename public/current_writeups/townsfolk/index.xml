      <description>The Orcs Killed Your Adopted Father: You know firsthand the brutality of the Bloody fist when they cut down Lozzuik Forgehand, your savior, right before you and made you watch. His crime was merely asking why he couldn’t have more food to feed his family. There was a fistfight, and they drug him into the street and beheaded him. This haunts you to this day. You generally keep to yourself but the hopefulness of avenging Lozzuik’s death with these new adventurers can’t be shaken.</description>

      <description>Storyteller: Balor is a gruff old grumpy Dwarf but a very honorable one. He has seen more battles with the monsters of Elysia than he cares to remember. You can always get him to talk about his glory days over a nice warm pint. No one knows the town of Stonewood better than Balor, he keeps tabs on everyone for the greater good of the town. Depending how the PCs interact with him, he will start to open up about rebellion or laugh at their dreams of liberating the town of Stonewood.</description>

      <description>Right Hand Man: You got stuck in an entry level job with a massive glass ceiling. Your boss, Mayor Anak is a total jerk and not the most liked person, but it pays the bills and the Bloody Fist don’t bother you so its “ok” living.
You CANNOT STAND Mayor Anak’s best friend Thorum! You think he is such and idiot and more of a coward than Anak is. The man was set for life, and he rolled it all away on dice when he could have taken over a jewelry empire in Stonewood.</description>

      <description>You HATE the Bloody Fist with a burning passion. They killed your childhood best friend Sorin Longoak the same day they severed your hand. Your friend died a hero saving people from the Bloody Fist but you were overwhelmed. You will cling to any hope you can that the Bloody Fist will be toppled! You will offer to help in anyway you can in secret.
Talk about the “endless horde” the Bloody Fist have at their disposal.</description>

      <description>Demand Obediance - Demand that any outsiders that arrive follow the rules of the occupation. Reference how safe things are with the Changed Ones patrolling.
Rude - Whenever anyone is talking cut them off. Don&amp;rsquo;t let them get in a word edgewise when they are speaking ot you. Walk away when you feel you have &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rdquo; the conversation.
Cowardly - If you are actually threatened in a meaningful way attempt to run.</description>

      <description>When reading a PCs fortune, ask lots of questions about their past. The bigger the responses from the player, engage them with a dark prophecy. These will be unique descriptive phrases given by plot to hint at events to come When the dark prophecies take over:
Touch the players arm and close your eyes. Start to mutter nonsense to yourself and open your eyes dramatically. Change your voice to much deeper and distort it so it sounds like someone else talking</description>

      <description>Town Drunk: Think of the most negative person you know and make them a Dwarf, that is Thorum Fairoak. This Dwarf cannot see the good in anything not involving Brews or Gambling. He used to be able to identify any gem or ore at a distance but that isn’t a skill he cares for now. Be very loud and obnoxious! You are the town drunk and you let people know your opinion on EVERYTHING</description>
